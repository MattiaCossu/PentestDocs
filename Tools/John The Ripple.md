[John the Ripper](https://github.com/openwall/john) (`JTR` or `john`) is a pentesting tool used to check the strength of passwords and crack encrypted (or hashed) passwords using either brute force or dictionary attacks.

Is based on cpu power.
The "Jumbo" variant is recommended for those in the security field cause is more powerful.

## Attack Methods
#### Dictionary Attacks
Dictionary attacks involve using a pre-generated list of words and phrases (known as a dictionary) to attempt to crack a password. This list of words and phrases is often acquired from various sources, such as publicly available dictionaries, leaked passwords, or even purchased from specialized companies. The dictionary is then used to generate a series of strings which are then used to compare against the hashed passwords. If a match is found, the password is cracked, providing an attacker access to the system and the data stored within it. This type of attack is highly effective. Therefore, it is essential to take the necessary steps to ensure that passwords are kept secure, such as using complex and unique passwords, regularly changing them, and using two-factor authentication.
#### Brute Force Attacks
Brute force attacks involve attempting every conceivable combination of characters that could form a password. This is an extremely slow process, and using this method is typically only advisable if there are no other alternatives. It is also important to note that the longer and more complex the password, the more difficult it is to crack and the longer it will take to exhaust every combination. For this reason, it is highly recommended that passwords be at least 8 characters in length, with a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols.
#### Rainbow Table Attacks
Rainbow table attacks involve using a pre-computed table of hashes and their corresponding plaintext passwords, which is a much faster method than a brute-force attack. However, this method is limited by the rainbow table size – the larger the table, the more passwords, and hashes it can store. Additionally, due to the nature of the attack, it is impossible to use rainbow tables to determine the plaintext of hashes not already included in the table. As a result, rainbow table attacks are only effective against hashes already present in the table, making the larger the table, the more successful the attack.

## Single Crack Mode
`Single Crack Mode` is one of the most common John modes used when attempting to crack passwords using a single password list. It is a brute-force attack, meaning all passwords on the list are tried, one by one, until the correct one is found.
```bash
john --format=<hash_type> <hash or hash_file>
john --format=<hash_type> <hash or hash_file> --wordlist=<wordlist> 
john --format=<hash_type> <hash or hash_file> --rules <rules>   # add role
john <hash or hash_file> --show               # retire pwd form pot file
```

Multiple wordlists can be specified by separating them with a comma.
These rules generate candidate passwords using transformations such as appending numbers, capitalizing letters and adding special characters.

## Incremental Mode
`Incremental Mode` is an advanced John mode used to crack passwords using a character set. It is a hybrid attack, which means it will attempt to match the password by trying all possible combinations of characters from the character set.

Use useful when we know the password format.
```bash
john --incremental <hash_file>
```

It is important to note that this mode is `highly resource intensive` and can take a long time to complete, depending on the complexity of the passwords, machine configuration, and the number of characters set.
Additionally, it is important to note that the default character set is limited to `a-zA-Z0-9`. Therefore, if we attempt to crack complex passwords with special characters, we need to use a custom character set.
