# Directory Fuzzing
```bash
ffuf -w ./SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt:FUZZ -u http://SERVER_IP:PORT/FUZZ -ic
```
## Recursive
```bash
ffuf -w ./SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt:FUZZ -u http://SERVER_IP:PORT/FUZZ -recursion -recursion-depth 1 -e .php -v -ic 
```

# Page Fuzzing
First in first we have to know what types of pages the website uses, like `.html`, `.php`, `.aspx`, or somethings else.
## Extension Fuzzing
```bash
ffuf -w ./SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/web-extensions.txt:FUZZ -u http://SERVER_IP:PORT/blog/indexFUZZ -ic
```

Before we start fuzzing, we must specify which file that extension would be at the end of! We can always use two wordlists and have a unique keyword for each, and then do `FUZZ_1.FUZZ_2` to fuzz for both. However, there is one file we can always find in most websites, which is `index.*`, so we will use it as our file and fuzz extensions on it.

Now, we can rerun our command, carefully placing our `FUZZ` keyword where the extension would be after `index`:
```bash
ffuf -w ./SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt:FUZZ -u http://SERVER_IP:PORT/blog/FUZZ.php -ic
```
