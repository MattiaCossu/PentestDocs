 
#ansible is an automation tool used for configuration management, application deployment, and task automation. Here's a breakdown of what this program does in simple human language:

  
1. `Global Definitions`: The program starts by defining a series of paths and constants related to Ansible playbooks and binaries, as well as an MD5 hash (AUTH_KEY_HASH) used for authentication. 
2. `Authentication`: The check_auth function calculates the MD5 hash of an input string (an authentication key) and compares it to the predefined AUTH_KEY_HASH. If the hashes match, it returns 1 (true), indicating successful authentication. 
3. `Listing Playbooks`: The listPlaybooks function scans the PLAYBOOK_LOCATION directory for files ending in .yml (which is a common file extension for Ansible playbooks) and lists them. It's to help the us know which playbooks are available for execution. 
4. `Running a Playbook`: The runPlaybook function takes the name of a playbook file, constructs a command line to run it with Ansible (ansible-playbook), and executes the command using the system function. 
5. `Installing a Role`: The installRole function is used to install an Ansible role from a given URL using the ansible-galaxy command. 
6. `Main Program Logic`: The main function processes command-line arguments and determines the mode of operation (list, run, install). It checks for authentication and, if successful, performs the requested operation: 
	- list: Lists all available playbooks. 
	- run: Runs a specific playbook by number. 
	- install: Installs an Ansible role from a URL.

_Simple Playbook_
```json
{ "run": { "action": "list|run|install", "auth_code": "the_auth_key" } }
```

## Install Process
For install we have to obtain an _tar.gz_ file that contains `role information`.
We can download it [them](https://github.com/coopdevs/ansible-role-template).
 
The template has a clear structure for an Ansible role skeleton generated byÂ ansible-galaxy init.
  
This _metadata_ folder must be included in the _.tar.gz_ to install. And there's a _tasks_ folder includes the tasks it's going to apply. Both folders include an important file called _main.yaml_. 
The _metadata_ does not contain tasks itself but describes the role and its requirements, such as the author, platform compatibility, and tags for categorization in Ansible Galaxy.

In Ansible, the role name is typically the name of the directory where the role is stored within our roles directory. We can identify the default directory by using this command:
```bash
cd .ansible && ansible-config dump | grep -i roles_path
```

When we use a role in a playbook, Ansible looks up this directory name under the paths specified by the _roles_path_ configuration. If we are using this template, it would then be sys-_admins-role-0.0.3_.

There should be a way to root by modifying the main.yaml in the tasks folder.
