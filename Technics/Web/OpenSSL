# Openssl
If we have a ss private key for a web site we can download from a web site the server cetificate.

And then Connection > More Information > View Certificate. Then in the popup window click on
Details > Export.

Export and save it in the folder.
Then follow these steps to create the certificate,

```bash
openssl genrsa -out client.key 4096
openssl req -new -key client.key -out client.req
openssl x509 -req -in client.req -CA lacasadepapelhtb.crt -CAkey ca.key -set_serial 101 -extensions client -days 365 -outform PEM -out client.cer
openssl pkcs12 -export -inkey client.key -in client.cer -out client.p12
rm client.key client.req client.cer
```

You should be left with a .p12 file which is the certificate.
Now upload the client.p12 to the browserâ€™s store. In firefox, go to Preferences > Privacy & Security
> View Certificates. Then in the Your Certificates section click on Import and import the cert
