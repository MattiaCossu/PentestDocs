#IDOR
The IDOR (Insecure Direct Object References) it's a techniques that allow as to require web resource that we should not be able to request.
We can find IDOR in some environment like:
- basically in identification parameters like ?id=1 
- in advanced scenario we can exploit encoded parameters, by encoding and hashing.
- Compering different user permission request
- Understanding front-end calls (es. AJAX)
- Understanding, if possible, back-end business flow

We have two type of _IDOR_:
- IDOR Information Disclosure Vulnerabilities
- IDOR Insecure Function Calls

# Some Useful Commands 
#reverse
This are very helpful with reverse engineering in encoding

For MD5 Hashing
```bash
echo -n 1 | base64 -w 0 | md5sum
echo -n 1 | md5sum

```

For URL Encoding
#url-encoding
```bash
$ printf %s 'encode this'|jq -sRr @uri
encode%20this
$ jq -rn --arg x 'encode this' '$x|@uri'
encode%20this
-r (--raw-output) outputs the raw contents of strings instead of JSON string literals. -n (--null-input) doesn't read input from STDIN.
-R (--raw-input) treats input lines as strings instead of parsing them as JSON, and -sR (--slurp --raw-input) reads the input into a single string. You can replace -sRr with -Rr if your input only contains a single line, or if you don't want to replace linefeeds with %0A:

$ echo -n $i | base64 -w 0 | printf "%s" $0 | jq -sRr @uri

$ printf %s\\n 'multiple lines' 'of text'|jq -Rr @uri
multiple%20lines
of%20text
$ printf %s\\n 'multiple lines' 'of text'|jq -sRr @uri
multiple%20lines%0Aof%20text%0A
Or this percent-encodes all bytes:

xxd -p|tr -d \\n|sed 's/../%&/g'
```
