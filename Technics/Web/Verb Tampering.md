Verb tampering is a techniques that allow us to modify a `HTTP Verb` (`Get` to `POST`) for abusing a backed and bypass filter if the web server is miss configured.
This type of vulnerable is based by two type of miss configuration:
- _Insecure Configurations_ -> Error in a Web Server.
- _Insecure Coding_ -> Coding Error.

For test it we can intercept the request with a proxy and change the verb.

Or by simple crafted request:
```bash
curl -x <VERB> <URL> --data <DATA>
```

Principle Verb are:

|Verb|Description|
|---|---|
|`HEAD`|Identical to a GET request, but its response only contains theÂ `headers`, without the response body|
|`PUT`|Writes the request payload to the specified location|
|`DELETE`|Deletes the resource at the specified location|
|`OPTIONS`|Shows different options accepted by a web server, like accepted HTTP verbs|
|`PATCH`|Apply partial modifications to the resource at the specified location|
