#### What is XML
_XML_ is a markup language for store document structure. 
Consist in a some _TAG_ divided by root tag and child tag
The above example shows some of the key elements of an XML document, like:

|Key|Definition|Example|

|`Tag`|The keys of an XML document, usually wrapped with (`<`/`>`) characters.|`<date>`|
|`Entity`|XML variables, usually wrapped with (`&`/`;`) characters.|`&lt;`|
|`Element`|The root element or any of its child elements, and its value is stored in between a start-tag and an end-tag.|`<date>01-01-2022</date>`|
|`Attribute`|Optional specifications for any element that are stored in the tags, which may be used by the XML parser.|`version="1.0"`/`encoding="UTF-8"`|
|`Declaration`|Usually the first line of an XML document, and defines the XML version and encoding to use when parsing it.|`<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>`|
