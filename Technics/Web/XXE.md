#XML  #XXE
_XXE_ (XML External Entity) it's a vulnerable which occurs when XML data is taken from a user-controlled input without properly sanitizing or safely parsing it, which may allow us to use XML features to perform malicious actions.
#### What is XML
_XML_ is a markup language for store document structure. 
Consist in a some _TAG_ divided by root tag and child tag
The above example shows some of the key elements of an XML document, like:

|Key|Definition|Example|
|---|---|---|
|`Tag`|The keys of an XML document, usually wrapped with (`<`/`>`) characters.|`<date>`|
|`Entity`|XML variables, usually wrapped with (`&`/`;`) characters.|`&lt;`|
|`Element`|The root element or any of its child elements, and its value is stored in between a start-tag and an end-tag.|`<date>01-01-2022</date>`|
|`Attribute`|Optional specifications for any element that are stored in the tags, which may be used by the XML parser.|`version="1.0"`/`encoding="UTF-8"`|
|`Declaration`|Usually the first line of an XML document, and defines the XML version and encoding to use when parsing it.|`<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>`|
##### DTD XML
Is a sort of types for an xml document.
DTD contain a custom XML structure.

A DTD can be declared in a top of XML after the _Declaration_, or import by _SYSTEM Properties_ or _URL_

_XML EXAMPLE_
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<email>
  <date>01-01-2022</date>
  <time>10:00 am UTC</time>
  <sender>john@inlanefreight.com</sender>
  <recipients>
    <to>HR@inlanefreight.com</to>
    <cc>
        <to>billing@inlanefreight.com</to>
        <to>payslips@inlanefreight.com</to>
    </cc>
  </recipients>
  <body>
  Hello,
      Kindly share with me the invoice for the payment made on January 1, 2022.
  Regards,
  John
  </body> 
</email>
```

_DTD EXAMPLE_
```xml
<!DOCTYPE email [
  <!ELEMENT email (date, time, sender, recipients, body)>
  <!ELEMENT recipients (to, cc?)>
  <!ELEMENT cc (to*)>
  <!ELEMENT date (#PCDATA)>
  <!ELEMENT time (#PCDATA)>
  <!ELEMENT sender (#PCDATA)>
  <!ELEMENT to  (#PCDATA)>
  <!ELEMENT body (#PCDATA)>
]>
```

_IMPORT BY SYSTEM_
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE email SYSTEM "email.dtd">
```

_IMPORT BY URL_
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE email SYSTEM "http://inlanefreight.com/email.dtd">
```
##### External Entity 
We may also define custom entities (i.e. XML variables) in XML DTDs, to allow refactoring of variables and reduce repetitive data. 

_ENTITY KEYWORD_
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE email [
  <!ENTITY company "Inlane Freight">
]>
```

Once we define an entity, it can be referenced in an XML document between an ampersand `&` and a semi-colon `;` (e.g. `&company;`).
However, we can `reference External XML Entities` with the `SYSTEM` keyword, which is followed by the external entity's path, as follows:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE email [
  <!ENTITY company SYSTEM "http://localhost/company.txt">
  <!ENTITY signature SYSTEM "file:///var/www/html/signature.txt">
]>
```

**Note:** We may also use the `PUBLIC` keyword instead of `SYSTEM` for loading external resources, which is used with publicly declared entities and standards, such as a language code (`lang="en"`).
