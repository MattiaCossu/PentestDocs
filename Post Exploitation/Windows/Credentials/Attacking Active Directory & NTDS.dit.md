#NTDS 
_NT Directory Services_ (_NTDS_) is the directory service used with AD to find & organize network resources.

The file are stored at -> _%systemroot%/ntds_ on DC
In the folder we can find _.dit_ file stands for [directory information tree](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19901-01/817-7607/dit.html).
This is the primary database file associated with AD and stores all domain usernames, password hashes, and other critical schema information.

**DUMP NTDS.dit**
To make a copy of the NTDS.dit file, we need local admin (_Administrators group_) or Domain Admin (_Domain Admins group_) (or equivalent) rights. We also will want to check what domain privileges we have.
```cmd
net localgroup
net user <USERS>
```
