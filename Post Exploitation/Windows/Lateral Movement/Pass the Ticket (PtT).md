Another method for moving laterally in an Active Directory environment is called a [Pass the Ticket (PtT) attack](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/003/).

We need a valid Kerberos ticket to perform a `Pass the Ticket (PtT)`. It can be:
- Service Ticket (TGS - Ticket Granting Service) to allow access to a particular resource.
- Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT), which we use to request service tickets to access any resource the user has privileges.
# Harvesting Kerberos Tickets from Windows
On Windows, tickets are processed and stored by the LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) process. Therefore, to get a ticket from a Windows system, you must communicate with LSASS and request it.

As user we can only get our _tickets_, but as local admin we can collect everything.
## Mimikatz
We can use _sekurlsa::tickets /export_ module from #mimikatz.
```cmd
mimikatz.exe
mimikatz # privilege::debug
mimikatz # sekurlsa::tickets /export

dir *.kirbi # The result list of files with the extension `.kirbi`, which contain the tickets.
``` 

> [!NOTE] Different ticket
> _$_ -> correspond to the computer account (cmd-session 0-2-40a50000-DC01$@cifs-DC01.inlanefreight.htb.kirbi)
_@_ -> correspond to user account ([randomvalue]-username@service-domain.local.kirbi)

**Note:** If you pick a ticket with the service krbtgt, it corresponds to the TGT of that account.
## Robeus
We can perform the same things with #robeus.
```cmd
Rubeus.exe dump /nowrap
```

# Pass the Key or OverPass the Hash
The traditional `Pass the Hash (PtH)` technique involves reusing an NTLM password hash that doesn't touch Kerberos. The `Pass the Key` or `OverPass the Hash` approach converts a hash/key (rc4_hmac, aes256_cts_hmac_sha1, etc.) for a domain-joined user into a full `Ticket-Granting-Ticket (TGT)`.
