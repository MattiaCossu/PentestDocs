A [Pass the Hash (PtH)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/002/) attack is a technique where an attacker uses a password hash instead of the plain text password for authentication.
# Windows 
## Mimikatz
For perform this techniques from a Windows Host we can use [Mimikatz](https://github.com/gentilkiwi).
```cmd
mimikatz.exe privilege::debug "sekurlsa::pth /user:<USER> /rc4:<HASH> /domain:<domain> /run:cmd.exe" exit
```

We can use _/NTLM_ opposite to _/rc4_
## Invoke-TheHash
Another tool we can use to perform Pass the Hash attacks on Windows is [Invoke-TheHash](https://github.com/Kevin-Robertson/Invoke-TheHash).
This tool is a collection of PowerShell functions for performing Pass the Hash attacks with WMI and SMB.
Local administrator privileges are not required client-side, but the user and hash we use to authenticate need to have administrative rights on the target computer. 
```powershell

```
