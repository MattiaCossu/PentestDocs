# Knowledge 
_LDAP_ ([Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol)) is an open-source and cross-platform protocol used for authentication against various directory services (such as AD).

LDAP uses port 389, and LDAP over SSL (LDAPS) communicates over port 636.
In a few words _LDAP_ is how system in the network can environment can "speck" to AD.

An LDAP session begins by first connecting to an LDAP server, also known as a _Directory System Agent_. The Domain Controller in AD actively listens for LDAP requests, such as security authentication requests.

Not only AD can use LDAP, but we can use LDAP we other platform whit a service like [OpenLDAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenLDAP).
## AD LDAP Authentication
LDAP is set up to authenticate credentials against AD using a "BIND" operation to set the authentication state for an LDAP session. There are two types of LDAP authentication.

1. `Simple Authentication`: This includes anonymous authentication, unauthenticated authentication, and username/password authentication. Simple authentication means that a `username` and `password` create a BIND request to authenticate to the LDAP server.
2. `SASL Authentication`: [The Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Authentication_and_Security_Layer) framework uses other authentication services, such as Kerberos, to bind to the LDAP server and then uses this authentication service (Kerberos in this example) to authenticate to LDAP. The LDAP server uses the LDAP protocol to send an LDAP message to the authorization service, which initiates a series of challenge/response messages resulting in either successful or unsuccessful authentication. SASL can provide additional security due to the separation of authentication methods from application protocols.

LDAP authentication messages are sent in cleartext by default so anyone can sniff out LDAP messages on the internal network. It is recommended to use TLS encryption or similar to safeguard this information in transit.
