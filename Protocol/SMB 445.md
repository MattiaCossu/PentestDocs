#SMB 
# Knowledge
Server Message Block (`SMB`) is a client-server protocol governing access to files, directories, and network resources like printers. Initially part of OS/2’s LAN Manager, it’s chiefly used within the Windows OS, allowing newer systems to communicate with older ones. Samba, a free software project, extends SMB to Linux and Unix, enabling cross-platform communication.

SMB facilitates communication between clients and network participants to access shared files or services. Both parties must implement the protocol, exchange messages, and establish a `TCP-based` connection through a `three-way handshake`. An SMB server can offer parts of its file system as shares, with access rights defined by Access Control Lists (`ACL`). These ACLs grant specific permissions to users or user groups, independent of local server rights.
## Samba - linux
Samba bridges Unix and Windows via `Common Internet File System` (`CIFS`), an `SMB` “dialect.” SMB versions differ in Windows support and features. Samba’s v3 supports Active Directory, v4 serves as a domain controller. Hosts in a workgroup connect via NetBIOS/WINS for naming and data sharing. However, CIFS is the extension of the SMB protocol. So when we pass SMB commands over Samba to an older NetBIOS service, it usually connects to the Samba server over TCP ports 137, 138, 139, but CIFS uses TCP port 445 only. There are several versions of SMB, including outdated versions that are still used in specific infrastructures.

|SMB Version|Supported|Features|
|---|---|---|
|CIFS|Windows NT 4.0|Communicates through NetBIOS interface|
|SMB 1.0|Windows 2000|Direct TCP connection|
|SMB 2.0|Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008|Enhanced performance, improved message signing, caching feature|
|SMB 2.1|Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2|Locking mechanisms|
|SMB 3.0|Windows 8, Windows Server 2012|Multichannel connections, end-to-end encryption, remote storage access|
|SMB 3.0.2|Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2||
|SMB 3.1.1|Windows 10, Windows Server 2016|Integrity checking, AES-128 encryption|

Presently, Samba’s version 3 empowers full Active Directory membership, while version 4 operates as an Active Directory domain controller. In the network environment, hosts in a workgroup collaborate, facilitated by the NetBIOS/WINS for naming and data exchange purposes. With version 4, Samba even provides an Active Directory domain controller. It contains several so-called daemons for this purpose - which are Unix background programs. The SMB server daemon (`smbd`) belonging to Samba provides the first two functionalities, while the NetBIOS message block daemon (`nmbd`) implements the last two functionalities. The SMB service controls these two background programs.

We know that Samba is suitable for both Linux and Windows systems. In a network, each host participates in the same workgroup. A `workgroup` is a group name that identifies an arbitrary collection of computers and their resources on an SMB network. There can be multiple workgroups on the network at any given time. IBM developed an application `programming interface` (`API`) for networking computers called the `Network Basic Input/Output System` (`NetBIOS`).
## Default Configuration
#configuration
As we can imagine, Samba offers a wide range of settings that we can configure. Again, we define the settings via a text file where we can get an overview of some of the settings.

```shell
cat /etc/samba/smb.conf | grep -v "#\|\;"
[global]
   workgroup = DEV.INFREIGHT.LOCAL
   server string = DEVSMB
   log file = /var/log/samba/log.%m
   max log size = 1000
   logging = file
   panic action = /usr/share/samba/panic-action %d

   server role = standalone server
   obey pam restrictions = yes
   unix password sync = yes

   passwd program = /usr/bin/passwd %u
   passwd chat = *Enter\snew\s*\spassword:* %n\n *Retype\snew\s*\spassword:* %n\n *password\supdated\ssuccessfully* .

   pam password change = yes
   map to guest = bad user
   usershare allow guests = yes

[printers]
   comment = All Printers
   browseable = no
   path = /var/spool/samba
   printable = yes
   guest ok = no
   read only = yes
   create mask = 0700

[print$]
   comment = Printer Drivers
   path = /var/lib/samba/printers
   browseable = yes
   read only = yes
   guest ok = no
```

We see global settings and two shares that are intended for printers. The global settings are the configuration of the available SMB server that is used for all shares.

|Setting|Description|
|---|---|
|[sharename]|The name of the network share.|
|workgroup = WORKGROUP/DOMAIN|Workgroup that will appear when clients query.|
|path = _path/here_|The directory to which the user is to be given access.|
|server string = STRING|The string that will show up when a connection is initiated.|
|unix password sync = yes|Synchronize the UNIX password with the SMB password?|
|usershare allow guests = yes|Allow non-authenticated users to access the defined share?|
|map to guest = bad user|What to do when a user login request doesn’t match a valid UNIX user?|
|browseable = yes|Should this share be shown in the list of available shares?|
|guest ok = yes|Allow connecting to the service without using a password?|
|read only = yes|Allow users to read files only?|
|create mask = 0700|What permissions need to be set for newly created files?|
## Dangerous Settings
#settings
The settings outlined in the configuration hold sensitivity. For instance, enabling ’`browseable = yes`’ offers convenience to employees, allowing easy access and navigation through shared folders for organizational purposes. However, this convenience extends to potential attackers who, upon gaining access, can exploit this setting to explore sensitive contents, posing a security risk to the company’s data. This dual nature of settings highlights the trade-off between user convenience and `potential vulnerabilities`.

|Setting|Description|
|---|---|
|browseable = yes|Allow listing available shares in the current share?|
|read only = no|Forbid the creation and modification of files?|
|writable = yes|Allow users to create and modify files?|
|guest ok = yes|Allow connecting to the service without using a password?|
|enable privileges = yes|Honor privileges assigned to specific SID?|
|create mask = 0777|What permissions must be assigned to the newly created files?|
|directory mask = 0777|What permissions must be assigned to the newly created directories?|
|logon script = script.sh|Script to be executed on the user’s login?|
|magic script = script.sh|Script to be executed when the session is closed?|
|magic output = script.out|Location to store the output of the magic script?|

## Example Share
#shares
In creating a share like `[notes]` and others, applying the settings as listed can significantly impact the enumeration process. Settings, commonly employed for testing purposes, might persist within internal subnets or small team environments in larger departments, inadvertently granting broad access. Failure to reset these settings leads to unintended consequences, allowing easy browsing, inspection, and potential download of shared data, posing a significant security risk.

```shell
...SNIP...

[notes]
	  comment = CheckIT
	  path = /mnt/notes/

	  browseable = yes
	  read only = no
	  writable = yes
	  guest ok = yes

	  enable privileges = yes
	  create mask = 0777
	  directory mask = 0777
```

It is highly recommended to look at the man pages for Samba and configure it ourselves and experiment with the settings. We will then discover potential aspects that will be interesting for us as a penetration tester. In addition, the more familiar we become with the Samba server and SMB, the easier it will be to find our way around the environment and use it for our purposes. Once we have adjusted `/etc/samba/smb.conf` to our needs, we have to restart the service on the server.
# Interact with SMB
_Restart Samba_
```shell
sudo systemctl restart smbd
```

_Connecting_
#smbclient
```shell
 smbclient -N -L //10.129.14.128
```

The Samba server now hosts five distinct shares, including the default ’`print$`’ and ’`IPC$`’ shares, established in the basic configuration. Focusing on the ’`[notes]`’ share, accessing and inspecting it through the client program allows for a closer examination. For those unfamiliar with the client program, leveraging the ’`help`’ command post-login reveals a comprehensive list of available commands, aiding navigation and execution within the share.

```shell
smbclient //10.129.14.128/notes
```

_Download_
Once we have discovered interesting files or folders, we can download them using the `get` command. Smbclient also allows us to execute local system commands using an exclamation mark at the beginning (`!<cmd>`) without interrupting the connection.

```shell
smb: \> get prep-prod.txt 

getting file \prep-prod.txt of size 71 as prep-prod.txt (8,7 KiloBytes/sec) 
(average 8,7 KiloBytes/sec)


smb: \> !ls

prep-prod.txt


smb: \> !cat prep-prod.txt

[] check your code with the templates
[] run code-assessment.py
[] …	
```
#### Samba Status

From an administrative perspective, ’`smbstatus`’ offers insights into active connections within the Samba server, displaying details such as connected clients, their originating hosts, and the accessed shares. This information becomes crucial, especially when navigating subnets or isolated networks accessible to others.

In domain-level security, the Samba server operates as part of a Windows domain, which typically includes at least one domain controller responsible for password authentication. The domain controller ensures secure authentication within the workgroup, managing user credentials in its `Security Authentication Module` (`SAM`). Upon user login and share access requests, these domain controllers authenticate users, enhancing security within the network.

```shell
Samba version 4.11.6-Ubuntu
PID     Username     Group        Machine                                   Protocol Version  Encryption           Signing

# Footprinting the Service
## nmap
#nmap
```shell
sudo nmap 10.129.14.128 -sV -sC -p139,445
```
## RPCclient
#rpcclient
We can see from the results that it is not very much that Nmap provided us with here. Therefore, we should resort to other tools that allow us to interact manually with the SMB and send specific requests for the information. One of the handy tools for this is `rpcclient`. This is a tool to perform MS-RPC functions.

The [Remote Procedure Call](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/remote-procedure-call-rpc-in-operating-system/) (`RPC`) is a concept and, therefore, also a central tool to realize operational and work-sharing structures in networks and client-server architectures. The communication process via RPC includes passing parameters and the return of a function value.

```shell
rpcclient -U "" 10.129.14.128
```

The `rpcclient` offers us many different requests with which we can execute specific functions on the SMB server to get information. A complete list of all these functions can be found on the man page of the rpcclient.

|Query|Description|
|---|---|
|srvinfo|Server information.|
|enumdomains|Enumerate all domains deployed in the network.|
|querydominfo|Provides domain, server, and user information of deployed domains.|
|netshareenumall|Enumerates all available shares.|
|netsharegetinfo <share>|Provides information about a specific share.|
|enumdomusers|Enumerates all domain users.|
|queryuser <RID>|Provides information about a specific user.|


```shell
rpcclient $> srvinfo
rpcclient $> enumdomains
rpcclient $> querydominfo
rpcclient $> netshareenumall
rpcclient $> netsharegetinfo notes
```

_Rpcclient - User Enumeration_
To illustrate user enumeration, the ‘rpcclient’ tool can be employed, showcasing how attackers could exploit vulnerabilities to enumerate users within the network.
```shell
rpcclient $> enumdomusers
rpcclient $> queryuser 0x3e9
```

_Rpcclient - Group Information_
We can then use the results to identify the group’s RID, which we can then use to retrieve information from the entire group.
```shell
rpcclient $> querygroup 0x201
```

_Brute Forcing User RIDs_
```shell
for i in $(seq 500 1100);do rpcclient -N -U "" 10.129.14.128 -c "queryuser 0x$(printf '%x\n' $i)" | grep "User Name\|user_rid\|group_rid" && echo "";done
```
## Impacket - Samrdump.py
#samrdump #impacket
An alternative to this would be a Python script from [Impacket](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket) called [samrdump.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/samrdump.py).
```shell
samrdump.py 10.129.14.128
```

The information we have already obtained with `rpcclient` can also be obtained using other tools. For example, the [SMBMap](https://github.com/ShawnDEvans/smbmap) and [CrackMapExec](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec) tools are also widely used and helpful for the enumeration of SMB services.
## SMBmap
#smbmap
```shell
smbmap -H 10.129.14.128
```

## CrackMapExec
#crackmapexec
```shell
crackmapexec smb 10.129.14.128 --shares -u '' -p ''
```
## enum4linux
#enum4linux
Another tool worth mentioning is the so-called [enum4linux-ng](https://github.com/cddmp/enum4linux-ng), which is based on an older tool, enum4linux. This tool automates many of the queries, but not all, and can return a large amount of information.  
### install
```shell
git clone https://github.com/cddmp/enum4linux-ng.git
cd enum4linux-ng
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Enumeration
```shell
./enum4linux-ng.py 10.179.114.128 -A
```
## Mount Shares
_Mount a Share directly in a linux file system_ 
```bash
mount -t cifs -o rw,username=<SMB USER>,password= '//<IP>/<SHARE>' /mnt
```

*TIPS*. With `password=` we can perform NULL Login.
