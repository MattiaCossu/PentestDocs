# Knowledge 
In windows other #LDAP and #KERBEROS, AD uses  uses several other authentication methods which can be used (and abused) by applications and services in AD. These include #LM, #NTLM, #NTLMv1, and #NTLMv2.

#LM and #NTLM here are the hash names.
#NTLMv1 and #NTLMv2 are authentication protocols that utilize the LM or NT hash.

_Hash Protocol Comparison_

|**Hash/Protocol**|**Cryptographic technique**|**Mutual Authentication**|**Message Type**|**Trusted Third Party**|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|`NTLM`|Symmetric key cryptography|No|Random number|Domain Controller|
|`NTLMv1`|Symmetric key cryptography|No|MD4 hash, random number|Domain Controller|
|`NTLMv2`|Symmetric key cryptography|No|MD4 hash, random number|Domain Controller|
|`Kerberos`|Symmetric key cryptography & asymmetric cryptography|Yes|Encrypted ticket using DES, MD5|Domain Controller/Key Distribution Center (KDC)|
## LN
#LM
`LAN Manager`Â (LM or LANMAN) hashes are the oldest password storage mechanism used by the Windows operating system.

If in use, they are stored 
- in the _SAM database_ on a ==Windows host==,
- in the _NTDS.DIT_ database on a ==Domain Controller==.
