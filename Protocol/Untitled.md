# Introduction
## Enumeration Methodology
### Enumeration in Cybersecurity

-   <span class="underline">Definition</span>: Enumeration involves **active** and **passive** information gathering methods to collect data about targets like `domains`, `IP addresses`, and `services`.
-   Distinct from <span class="underline">OSINT</span>: It's different from `OSINT` (Open-Source Intelligence), which relies solely on passive information gathering without actively probing the target.
### Approach to Investigation:

-   <span class="underline">Understanding Infrastructure</span>: Rather than forcefully breaching systems, focus on `comprehending` the **infrastructure** and `necessary technical aspects`.
-   <span class="underline">Avoid Noisy Method</span>: Avoid noisy methods like `brute-forcing`, as they can **trigger** security measures and hinder further investigation.


<a id="org9fe0395"></a>

### Analogous Approach

-   <span class="underline">Treasure Hunter Analogy</span>: Similar to a treasure hunter planning with `maps` and `tools` instead of randomly digging holes, `understand` the company's `infrastructure` before attempting to breach it.
### Enumeration Principles

-   <span class="underline">Seeing Beyond the Obvious</span>: Consider all perspectives; there's more to uncover than what initially meets the eye.
-   <span class="underline">Distinguishing Seen and Unseen Aspects</span>: Understand the difference between `visible` and `hidden` elements.
-   <span class="underline">Continuous Information Gathering</span>: Always seek ways to understand the target better; there's more information available than what's initially apparent.
### Application of Principles

<span class="underline">Constant Reminder</span>: Write down these principles and questions for easy reference during investigations.
These principles guide cybersecurity professionals to delve deeper, consider multiple angles, and continuously gather information to understand and potentially exploit a target's vulnerabilities.

## Enumeration Methodology

The enumeration methodology in cybersecurity follows a structured approach with six layers, navigating through `infrastructure`, `host`, and `operating system` aspects. It provides flexibility to adapt to diverse target systems, ensuring a comprehensive assessment without overlooking crucial details.

In assessments, we often encounter gaps, yet not all lead to entry. Time-limited penetration tests can't assure uncovering all vulnerabilities. Extensive study exceeds our brief assessments; the SolarWinds cyber attack exemplifies this. A robust methodology must consider such cases.

Consider an external 'black box' penetration test. Upon meeting contract requirements, the assessment commences as scheduled.


<a id="org888a398"></a>

### Layer

1.  Layer No.1: Internet Presence

    This initial layer focuses on identifying targets for investigation, crucially so if the contract scope allows exploring additional hosts. Utilizing diverse techniques, we seek domains, subdomains, netblocks, and various elements indicating the company's online presence.
    <span class="underline">Goal</span>: `Identify all possible target systems and interfaces for testing`.

2.  Layer No.2: Gateway

    Here, we delve into understanding the reachable target's interface, its protective measures, and network placement. Due to diversity and complexities, this layer requires detailed exploration in subsequent modules.
    <span class="underline">Goal</span>: `Grasp the nature of the target and recognize potential risks`.

3.  Layer No.3: Accessible Services

    This layer involves scrutinizing each service's purpose within accessible destinations. Understanding their functions is crucial for effective interaction or exploitation.
    <span class="underline">Goal</span>: `Comprehend service functionalities and communication methods for effective exploitation`.

4.  Layer No.4: Processes

    Every command or function initiates data processing, creating tasks with identifiable sources and targets.
    <span class="underline">Goal</span>: `Understand these processes and dependencies between them`.

5.  Layer No.5: Privileges

    Services operate under specific user and group privileges set by administrators or systems, often overlooked but offering critical functionalities.
    <span class="underline">Goal</span>: `Identify and comprehend available privileges and their capabilities`.

6.  Layer No.6: OS Setup

    Gathering internal access-derived data about the operating system and setup reveals insights into internal security and administrative competencies.
    <span class="underline">Goal</span>: `Assess administrators' system management and extract sensitive internal information`.
    
    A methodology summarizes all systematic procedures in obtaining knowledge within the bounds of a given objective. It is important to note that a methodology is not a step-by-step guide but, as the definition implies, a summary of systematic procedures. In our case, the enumeration methodology is the systematic approach to explore a given target.

# Infrastructure Based Enumeration


<a id="org2ae6908"></a>

## Domain Information

Domain info vital for tests; beyond subdomains, it reveals a company's online presence. Passive gathering, discreet as 'visitors,' uncovers tech needs. Analyzing sites unveils services, insights into structure. Understanding unseen tech enriches assessments. We pay attention to what `we see` and `we do not see`.


<a id="orgb2c4898"></a>

### Online Presence

Basic understanding acquired, we delve into the company's **online presence**.
Imagine a scenario: a medium-sized firm hires us for a black-box test with limited target scope.
<span class="underline">Our task</span>: `gather all necessary info independently`.

Exploration <span class="underline">begins</span> with the `SSL certificate` from the <span class="underline">main website</span>, often encompassing multiple active domains, offering initial insight into the company's online footprint.
Another valuable resource is [crt.sh](https://crt.sh/), leveraging `Certificate Transparency logs`, enabling verification of issued digital certificates. This process aids in detecting false or malicious certificates, providing access to stored entries for analysis.
SSL certificate providers like [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) share this with the web interface [crt.sh](https://crt.sh/), which stores the new entries in the database to be accessed later.


<a id="orgbb326ab"></a>

### Certificate Transparency

Analysis privided by [crt.sh](https://crt.sh/)

    curl -s https://crt.sh/\?q\=inlanefreight.com\&output\=json | jq .

If needed, we can also have them filtered by the unique subdomains.

    curl -s https://crt.sh/\?q\=inlanefreight.com\&output\=json | jq . | grep name | cut -d":" -f2 | grep -v "CN=" | cut -d'"' -f2 | awk '{gsub(/\\n/,"\n");}1;' | sort -u

Next, we can identify the hosts directly accessible from the Internet and not hosted by third-party providers. This is because we are not allowed to test the hosts without the permission of third-party providers.


<a id="org464a3fb"></a>

### Company Hosted Servers

    for i in $(cat subdomainlist);do host $i | grep "has address" | grep inlanefreight.com | cut -d" " -f1,4;done

Once we see which hosts can be investigated further, we can generate a list of IP addresses with a minor adjustment to the `cut` command and run them through `Shodan`.


<a id="orgfbdf4e3"></a>

### Shodan - IP List

    for i in $(cat subdomainlist);do host $i | grep "has address" | grep inlanefreight.com | cut -d" " -f4 >> ip-addresses.txt;done
    for i in $(cat ip-addresses.txt);do shodan host $i;done

now it is important to continue analyzing the `DNS` for exemple:

    dig any example.com


<a id="org20fa2dc"></a>

## Cloud Resources

The use of cloud, such as AWS, GCP, Azure, and others, is now one of the essential components for many companies nowadays.
For this reason we have to understand this stuff.
This often starts with the `S3 buckets` (AWS), `blobs` (Azure), `cloud storage` (GCP), which can be accessed without authentication if configured incorrectly.


<a id="org4443028"></a>

### Company Hosted Servers

    for i in $(cat subdomainlist);do host $i | grep "has address" | grep inlanefreight.com | cut -d" " -f1,4;done


<a id="org482af5a"></a>

### Google Search for AWS

One of the easiest and most used is Google search combined with Google Dorks. For example, we can use the Google Dorks `inurl:` Domain (like amazonaws.com) and `intext:` Company name to narrow our search to specific terms.

-   `AWS` => inurl:amazonaws.com
-   `Azure` => inurl:blob.core.windows.net


<a id="org0c76b48"></a>

### Third-party providers

Third-party providers such as domain.glass can also tell us a lot about the company's infrastructure.

-   [domain.glass](https://domain.glass/)
-   [grayhatwarefare.com](https://buckets.grayhatwarfare.com/)


<a id="org5b11b8c"></a>

## Staff

Analyzing social media profiles of employees can provide insights into a company's infrastructure and technology stack.

-   `Job postings` can reveal the preferred programming languages, databases, web frameworks, and version control systems used by a company.
-   `Employee profiles` can showcase their skills and projects, indicating their expertise and the technologies they are familiar with.
-   `GitHub repositories` linked to employee profiles can provide direct access to code and potential vulnerabilities.
-   `LinkedIn` offers advanced search options to filter employees based on their expertise and connections.
-   `Targeting technical employees` in both development and security teams can provide a comprehensive understanding of the company's infrastructure and security posture.

# Host Based Enumeration


<a id="org6342198"></a>

## FTP\\20,21


<a id="org343de9d"></a>

### FTP (File Transfer Protocol)

One of the oldest Internet protocols, operating within the application layer of the `TCP/IP stack`. It establishes control and data channels through TCP ports 21 and 20 respectively. FTP supports active/passive modes, various commands, and status codes for file management. Requires credentials for access, though some servers may offer restricted anonymous FTP. Vulnerable to sniffing as it operates as a clear-text protocol.


<a id="org08c506d"></a>

### TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol)

Simpler than FTP, uses `UDP`, lacks user authentication, and advanced features. Access is limited by OS file permissions, making it suitable only for local and protected networks. Supports basic commands for file transfer but lacks directory listing functionality.
Let us take a look at a few `commands of TFTP`:

<td class="org-left">verbose</td>
<td class="org-left">Turns verbose mode (additional information during file transfer) on or off.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<a id="org7907cad"></a>

### Default Configuration

One of the most used FTP servers on Linux-based distributions is [vsFTPd](https://security.appspot.com/vsftpd.html). The default configuration of vsFTPd can be found in `/etc/vsftpd.conf`, and some settings are already predefined by default.

1.  Install vsFTPd

        sudo apt install vsftpd 

2.  vsFTPd Config File

        cat /etc/vsftpd.conf | grep -v "#"

    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
    
    In addition, there is a file called `/etc/ftpusers` that we also need to pay attention to, as this file is used to deny certain users access to the FTP service.
    
        cat /etc/ftpusers
        
        guest

3.  Dangerous Settings

    FTP servers offer numerous security-related configurations to test connections, routes, and authentication methods. Among these mechanisms is the anonymous user, commonly used within internal networks to facilitate file and data sharing without direct access to individual computers. For vsFTPd, configuration settings for anonymous login include:

    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
    
    -   <span class="underline">Access via FTP Client</span>: Using the standard FTP client (`ftp`) allows access to the FTP server with the configured `anonymous user` if the aforementioned settings have been applied.
    -   <span class="underline">Usage in Internal Environments</span>: The anonymous account is utilized in known internal environments or infrastructures where participants are recognized. This facilitates file exchange, either temporarily or as a consistent setting.
    -   <span class="underline">vsFTPd Server Connection</span>:
        -   Response Code: Upon connection to the vsFTPd server, it responds with the `code 220`, displaying the FTP server `banner`.
        -   Banner Content: The banner typically contains `service description`, `version details`, and the `system type` of the FTP server.
    -   <span class="underline">Anonymous Access Configuration</span>:
        -   Common Configuration: Many FTP servers are configured to `allow anonymous access`, granting access to certain files without requiring legitimate credentials.
        -   Access Benefits: Even if downloading files is restricted, listing the file contents can provide valuable insights, aiding in generating ideas or collecting information for alternative approaches.

    In the following example, we can see that if the `hide_ids=YES` setting is present, the `UID` and `GUID` representation of the service will be overwritten, making it more difficult for us to identify with which rights these files are written and uploaded.
    
        ftp> ls

    This setting is a security feature to prevent local usernames from being revealed. With the usernames, we could attack the services like FTP and SSH and many others with a brute-force attack in theory.

5.  Recursive Listing

    Another helpful setting we can use for our purposes is the `ls_recurse_enable=YES`. This is often set on the vsFTPd server to have a better overview of the FTP directory structure, as it allows us to see all the visible content at once.
    
        ftp> ls -R
        
        ---> PORT 10,10,14,4,222,149
        200 PORT command successful. Consider using PASV.
        ---> LIST -R
        150 Here comes the directory listing.

6.  Download a File

    Downloading files from such an FTP server is one of the main features, as well as uploading files created by us.
    this paves the way for techniques such as `LFI` or `RCE`.
    
        ftp> ls
        
        200 PORT command successful. Consider using PASV.
        150 Here comes the directory listing.

### Footprinting the Service

1.  Nmap FTP Scripts

        sudo nmap --script-updatedb
    
    All the NSE scripts are located in `/usr/share/nmap/scripts/`, but on our systems, we can find them using a simple command on our system.
    
        find / -type f -name ftp* 2>/dev/null | grep scripts

2.  Nmap

    As we already know, the FTP server usually runs on the standard `TCP` `port 21`, which we can scan using Nmap. We also use the version scan (`-sV`), aggressive scan (`-A)`, and the default script scan (`-sC`) against our target 10.179.114.136.
    
        sudo nmap -sV -p21 -sC -A 10.129.14.136

3.  Nmap Script Trace

        sudo nmap -sV -p21 -sC -A 10.179.114.136 --script-trace

4.  Service Interaction

    If necessary, we can, of course, use other applications such as `netcat` or `telnet` to interact with the FTP server.
    
        nc -nv 10.129.14.136 21
    
        telnet 10.129.14.136 21
    
    It looks slightly different if the FTP server runs with TLS/SSL encryption. Because then we need a client that can handle TLS/SSL. For this, we can use the client openssl and communicate with the FTP server. The good thing about using `openssl` is that we can see the SSL certificate, which can also be helpful.
    
        openssl s_client -connect 10.129.14.136:21 -starttls ftp
        
        CONNECTED(00000003)                                                                                      
        Can't use SSL_get_servername                        
        depth=0 C = US, ST = California, L = Sacramento, O = Inlanefreight, OU = Dev, CN = master.inlanefreight.htb, emailAddress = admin@inlanefreight.htb
        verify error:num=18:self signed certificate
        verify return:1
        
        depth=0 C = US, ST = California, L = Sacramento, O = Inlanefreight, OU = Dev, CN = master.inlanefreight.htb, emailAddress = admin@inlanefreight.htb
        verify return:1
        ---                                                 
        Certificate chain
         0 s:C = US, ST = California, L = Sacramento, O = Inlanefreight, OU = Dev, CN = master.inlanefreight.htb, emailAddress = admin@inlanefreight.htb
        
         i:C = US, ST = California, L = Sacramento, O = Inlanefreight, OU = Dev, CN = master.inlanefreight.htb, emailAddress = admin@inlanefreight.htb
        ---
        
        Server certificate
        
        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        
        MIIENTCCAx2gAwIBAgIUD+SlFZAWzX5yLs2q3ZcfdsRQqMYwDQYJKoZIhvcNAQEL
        ...SNIP...	
    
    This is because the SSL certificate allows us to recognize the `hostname`, for example, and in most cases also an `email address` for the organization or company.

## SMB\\445

Server Message Block (`SMB`) is a client-server protocol governing access to files, directories, and network resources like printers. Initially part of OS/2's LAN Manager, it's chiefly used within the Windows OS, allowing newer systems to communicate with older ones. Samba, a free software project, extends SMB to Linux and Unix, enabling cross-platform communication. 

SMB facilitates communication between clients and network participants to access shared files or services. Both parties must implement the protocol, exchange messages, and establish a `TCP-based` connection through a `three-way handshake`. An SMB server can offer parts of its file system as shares, with access rights defined by Access Control Lists (`ACL`). These ACLs grant specific permissions to users or user groups, independent of local server rights.


<a id="orgc072d18"></a>

### Samba

Samba bridges Unix and Windows via `Common Internet File System` (`CIFS`), an `SMB` "dialect." SMB versions differ in Windows support and features. Samba's v3 supports Active Directory, v4 serves as a domain controller. Hosts in a workgroup connect via NetBIOS/WINS for naming and data sharing.
However, CIFS is the extension of the SMB protocol. So when we pass SMB commands over Samba to an older NetBIOS service, it usually connects to the Samba server over TCP ports 137, 138, 139, but CIFS uses TCP port 445 only. There are several versions of SMB, including outdated versions that are still used in specific infrastructures.

Presently, Samba's version 3 empowers full Active Directory membership, while version 4 operates as an Active Directory domain controller. In the network environment, hosts in a workgroup collaborate, facilitated by the NetBIOS/WINS for naming and data exchange purposes.
With version 4, Samba even provides an Active Directory domain controller. It contains several so-called daemons for this purpose - which are Unix background programs. The SMB server daemon (`smbd`) belonging to Samba provides the first two functionalities, while the NetBIOS message block daemon (`nmbd`) implements the last two functionalities. The SMB service controls these two background programs.

We know that Samba is suitable for both Linux and Windows systems. In a network, each host participates in the same workgroup. A `workgroup` is a group name that identifies an arbitrary collection of computers and their resources on an SMB network. There can be multiple workgroups on the network at any given time. IBM developed an application `programming interface` (`API`) for networking computers called the `Network Basic Input/Output System` (`NetBIOS`).

1.  Default Configuration

    As we can imagine, Samba offers a wide range of settings that we can configure. Again, we define the settings via a text file where we can get an overview of some of the settings.
    
        cat /etc/samba/smb.conf | grep -v "#\|\;"
        [global]
           workgroup = DEV.INFREIGHT.LOCAL
           server string = DEVSMB
           log file = /var/log/samba/log.%m
           max log size = 1000
           logging = file
           panic action = /usr/share/samba/panic-action %d
        
           server role = standalone server
           obey pam restrictions = yes
           unix password sync = yes
        
           passwd program = /usr/bin/passwd %u
           passwd chat = *Enter\snew\s*\spassword:* %n\n *Retype\snew\s*\spassword:* %n\n *password\supdated\ssuccessfully* .
        
           pam password change = yes
           map to guest = bad user
           usershare allow guests = yes
        
        [printers]
           comment = All Printers
           browseable = no
           path = /var/spool/samba
           printable = yes
           guest ok = no
           read only = yes
           create mask = 0700
        
        [print$]
           comment = Printer Drivers
           path = /var/lib/samba/printers
           browseable = yes
           read only = yes
           guest ok = no
    
    We see global settings and two shares that are intended for printers. The global settings are the configuration of the available SMB server that is used for all shares.

2.  Dangerous Settings

    The settings outlined in the configuration hold sensitivity. For instance, enabling '`browseable = yes`' offers convenience to employees, allowing easy access and navigation through shared folders for organizational purposes. However, this convenience extends to potential attackers who, upon gaining access, can exploit this setting to explore sensitive contents, posing a security risk to the company's data. This dual nature of settings highlights the trade-off between user convenience and `potential vulnerabilities`.

3.  Example Share

    In creating a share like `[notes]` and others, applying the settings as listed can significantly impact the enumeration process. Settings, commonly employed for testing purposes, might persist within internal subnets or small team environments in larger departments, inadvertently granting broad access. Failure to reset these settings leads to unintended consequences, allowing easy browsing, inspection, and potential download of shared data, posing a significant security risk.
    
        ...SNIP...
        
        [notes]
                comment = CheckIT
                path = /mnt/notes/
        
                browseable = yes
                read only = no
                writable = yes
                guest ok = yes
        
                enable privileges = yes
                create mask = 0777
                directory mask = 0777
    
    It is highly recommended to look at the man pages for Samba and configure it ourselves and experiment with the settings. We will then discover potential aspects that will be interesting for us as a penetration tester. In addition, the more familiar we become with the Samba server and SMB, the easier it will be to find our way around the environment and use it for our purposes. Once we have adjusted `/etc/samba/smb.conf` to our needs, we have to restart the service on the server.

4.  Restart Samba

        sudo systemctl restart smbd

5.  SMBclient - Connecting to the Share

        smbclient -N -L //10.129.14.128
        
                Sharename       Type      Comment
                ---------       ----      -------
                print$          Disk      Printer Drivers
                home            Disk      INFREIGHT Samba
                dev             Disk      DEVenv
                notes           Disk      CheckIT
                IPC$            IPC       IPC Service (DEVSM)
              SMB1 disabled -- no workgroup available
    
    The Samba server now hosts five distinct shares, including the default '`print$`' and '`IPC$`' shares, established in the basic configuration. Focusing on the '`[notes]`' share, accessing and inspecting it through the client program allows for a closer examination. For those unfamiliar with the client program, leveraging the '`help`' command post-login reveals a comprehensive list of available commands, aiding navigation and execution within the share.
    
        smbclient //10.129.14.128/notes
        
        Enter WORKGROUP\<username>'s password: 
        Anonymous login successful
        Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.

6.  Download Files from SMB

    Once we have discovered interesting files or folders, we can download them using the `get` command. Smbclient also allows us to execute local system commands using an exclamation mark at the beginning (`!<cmd>`) without interrupting the connection.
    
        smb: \> get prep-prod.txt 
        
        getting file \prep-prod.txt of size 71 as prep-prod.txt (8,7 KiloBytes/sec) 
        (average 8,7 KiloBytes/sec)
        
        
        smb: \> !ls
        
        prep-prod.txt
        
        
        smb: \> !cat prep-prod.txt
        
        [] check your code with the templates
        [] run code-assessment.py
        [] …	

7.  Samba Status

    From an administrative perspective, '`smbstatus`' offers insights into active connections within the Samba server, displaying details such as connected clients, their originating hosts, and the accessed shares. This information becomes crucial, especially when navigating subnets or isolated networks accessible to others.
    
    In domain-level security, the Samba server operates as part of a Windows domain, which typically includes at least one domain controller responsible for password authentication. The domain controller ensures secure authentication within the workgroup, managing user credentials in its `Security Authentication Module` (`SAM`). Upon user login and share access requests, these domain controllers authenticate users, enhancing security within the network.

2.  RPCclient

    We can see from the results that it is not very much that Nmap provided us with here. Therefore, we should resort to other tools that allow us to interact manually with the SMB and send specific requests for the information. One of the handy tools for this is `rpcclient`. This is a tool to perform MS-RPC functions.
    
    The [Remote Procedure Call](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/remote-procedure-call-rpc-in-operating-system/) (`RPC`) is a concept and, therefore, also a central tool to realize operational and work-sharing structures in networks and client-server architectures. The communication process via RPC includes passing parameters and the return of a function value.
    
        rpcclient -U "" 10.129.14.128
        
        Enter WORKGROUP\'s password:
        rpcclient $> 
    
    The `rpcclient` offers us many different requests with which we can execute specific functions on the SMB server to get information. A complete list of all these functions can be found on the man page of the rpcclient.

    The examples provided highlight the potential information leakage to `anonymous users` within a network. Granting access to network services to anonymous users can inadvertently expose critical information or grant excessive permissions, posing a significant risk to the entire network's security.
    
    Anonymous access not only jeopardizes the network but also facilitates the discovery of other users, potentially leading to aggressive brute-force attacks. Human error, coupled with inadequate security awareness and lax password practices, often results in weak passwords vulnerable to easy cracking.

4.  Rpcclient - User Enumeration

    To illustrate user enumeration, the 'rpcclient' tool can be employed, showcasing how attackers could exploit vulnerabilities to enumerate users within the network.
    
        rpcclient $> enumdomusers
        
        user:[mrb3n] rid:[0x3e8]
        user:[cry0l1t3] rid:[0x3e9]
        
        
        rpcclient $> queryuser 0x3e9

5.  Rpcclient - Group Information

    We can then use the results to identify the group's RID, which we can then use to retrieve information from the entire group.
    
        rpcclient $> querygroup 0x201
        
                Group Name:     None
                Description:    Ordinary Users
                Group Attribute:7
                Num Members:2

6.  Brute Forcing User RIDs

        for i in $(seq 500 1100);do rpcclient -N -U "" 10.129.14.128 -c "queryuser 0x$(printf '%x\n' $i)" | grep "User Name\|user_rid\|group_rid" && echo "";done
        
                User Name   :   sambauser
                user_rid :      0x1f5
                group_rid:      0x201
        
                User Name   :   mrb3n
                user_rid :      0x3e8
                group_rid:      0x201
        
                User Name   :   cry0l1t3
                user_rid :      0x3e9
                group_rid:      0x201

    The information we have already obtained with `rpcclient` can also be obtained using other tools. For example, the [SMBMap](https://github.com/ShawnDEvans/smbmap) and [CrackMapExec](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec) tools are also widely used and helpful for the enumeration of SMB services.

    Another tool worth mentioning is the so-called [enum4linux-ng](https://github.com/cddmp/enum4linux-ng), which is based on an older tool, enum4linux. This tool automates many of the queries, but not all, and can return a large amount of information.
    
    1.  Install
    
            git clone https://github.com/cddmp/enum4linux-ng.git

## NFS\\111,2049

`Network File System` (`NFS`) is a network file system developed by Sun Microsystems and has the same purpose as **SMB**. Its purpose is to access file systems over a network as if they were local. 
NFS is used between Linux and Unix systems. This means that NFS clients cannot communicate directly with SMB servers.

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">

<tr>
<td class="org-left">NFSv2</td>
<td class="org-left">Older version widely supported by many systems; originally operated solely over UDP.</td>

<tr>
<td class="org-left">NFSv3</td>
<td class="org-left">Offers additional features like variable file size, improved error reporting, but lacks full compatibility with NFSv2 clients.</td>

<td class="org-left">NFSv4</td>
<td class="org-left">Introduces Kerberos authentication, functions efficiently across firewalls and the internet, eliminates portmappers, supports ACLs, applies state-based operations, enhances performance, and prioritizes high security. First version with a stateful protocol.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

A significant advantage of `NFSv4` over its predecessors is that only one UDP or TCP port `2049` is used to run the service, which simplifies the use of the protocol <span class="underline">across firewalls</span>.
NFS is based on the Open Network Computing Remote Procedure Call (`ONC-RPC` / `SUN-RPC`) protocol exposed on `TCP` and `UDP` ports `111`, which uses External Data Representation (`XDR`) for the system-independent exchange of data. The NFS protocol has no mechanism for `authentication` or `authorization`.
The most common authentication is via UNIX  `UID` / `GID` and `group memberships`, which is why this syntax is most likely to be applied to the NFS protocol.


<a id="orge496385"></a>

### Default Configuration

The configuration are provided into `/etc/exports`, the file is like:

    # /etc/exports: the access control list for filesystems which may be exported
    #               to NFS clients.  See exports(5).
    #
    # Example for NFSv2 and NFSv3:
    # /srv/homes       hostname1(rw,sync,no_subtree_check) hostname2(ro,sync,no_subtree_check)
    #
    # Example for NFSv4:
    # /srv/nfs4        gss/krb5i(rw,sync,fsid=0,crossmnt,no_subtree_check)
    # /srv/nfs4/homes  gss/krb5i(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)

1.  ExportFS

        echo '/mnt/nfs  10.129.14.0/24(sync,no_subtree_check)' >> /etc/exports
        systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server
        exportfs
    
    We have shared the folder `/mnt/nfs` to the subnet `10.129.14.0/24` with the setting shown above

2.  Dangerous Settings

    Here are some of them listed:
    
    <table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">
    
    
    <colgroup>
    <col  class="org-left" />
    
    <col  class="org-left" />
    </colgroup>
    <thead>
    <tr>
    <th scope="col" class="org-left">Option</th>
    <th scope="col" class="org-left">Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    
    <tbody>
    <tr>
    <td class="org-left">rw</td>
    <td class="org-left">Grants both read and write permissions.</td>
    </tr>
    
    
    <tr>
    <td class="org-left">insecure</td>
    <td class="org-left">Permits the utilization of ports above 1024 for NFS operations.</td>
    </tr>
    
    
    <tr>
    <td class="org-left">nohide</td>
    <td class="org-left">Ensures that if another filesystem is mounted below an exported directory, it gets its own exports entry.</td>
    </tr>
    
    
    <tr>
    <td class="org-left">no<sub>root</sub><sub>squash</sub></td>
    <td class="org-left">Retains files created by root with the UID/GID 0, bypassing the usual mapping to anonymous UID/GID for security.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
    
    We can take a look at the insecure option. This is dangerous because users can use ports above 1024. The first 1024 ports can only be used by root. This prevents the fact that no users can use sockets above port 1024 for the NFS service and interact with it.

### Footprinting the Service

1.  Nmap

        sudo nmap 10.129.14.128 -p111,2049 -sV -sC
    
    The `rpcinfo` NSE script retrieves a list of all currently running RPC services, their names and descriptions, and the ports they use.
    
        sudo nmap --script nfs* 10.129.14.128 -sV -p111,2049

2.  Show Available NFS Shares

        showmount -e 10.129.14.128

3.  Mounting NFS Share

        mkdir target-NFS
        sudo mount -t nfs 10.129.14.128:/ ./target-NFS/ -o nolock
        cd target-NFS
        treee .

4.  List Contents with Usernames & Group Names

        ls -l mnt/nfs/

5.  List Contents with UIDs & GUIDs

        ls -n mnt/nfs/

6.  Unmounting

        cd ..
        sudo umount ./target-NFS

## DNS\\53(UDP)

`DNS`, an integral part of the Internet, facilitates access to web servers via `domain names` like bard.google.com or www.google.com, mapping them to `specific IP` addresses provided by hosting providers. It operates as a `system converting computer names` into IP addresses without a central database, resembling a vast library housing various phone books. This information disperses across thousands of name servers globally. <span class="underline">These distributed DNS servers translate domain names to IP addresses</span>, directing users to specific servers associated with a domain. Various types of DNS servers are employed worldwide to manage this functionality.

DNS is mainly unencrypted. Devices on the local WLAN and Internet providers can therefore hack in and spy on DNS queries. Since this poses a privacy risk, there are now some solutions for DNS encryption. By default, IT security professionals apply `DNS over TLS` (`DoT`) or `DNS over HTTPS` (`DoH`) here. In addition, the network protocol `DNSCrypt` also encrypts the traffic between the computer and the name server.

Different `DNS records` are used for the DNS queries, which all have various tasks. Moreover, separate entries exist for different functions since we can set up mail servers and other servers for a domain.

### Default Configuration

There are many different configuration types for DNS.
All DNS servers work with three different types of hierarchical configuration files:

1.  `local` DNS configuration files
2.  `zone` files
3.  `reverse` name resolution files

The DNS server [Bind9](https://www.isc.org/bind/) is very often used on Linux-based distributions. Its local configuration file (named.conf) is roughly divided into two sections, firstly the options section for general settings and secondly the zone entries for the individual domains. The local configuration files are usually:

-   named.conf.local
-   named.conf.options
-   named.conf.log

The configuration file `named.conf` is divided into several options that control the behavior of the name server. A distinction is made between `global options` and `zone options`.

1.  Local DNS Configuration

        cat /etc/bind/named.conf.local
        
        //
        // Do any local configuration here
        //
        
        // Consider adding the 1918 zones here, if they are not used in your
        // organization
        //include "/etc/bind/zones.rfc1918";
        zone "domain.com" {
            type master;
            file "/etc/bind/db.domain.com";
            allow-update { key rndc-key; };
        };

2.  Zone Files

    Zone files define individual DNS zones and are usually dedicated to one domain, except for ISP and public DNS servers. They utilize the BIND file format, a standard in DNS server software. These text files include essential records like `SOA` and `NS`, ensuring completeness and accuracy. Any syntax error renders the entire file unusable, causing DNS queries for that zone to receive a SERVFAIL error. Essentially, zone files function as a structured phone book for DNS servers, detailing domain-to-IP address mappings following BIND format rules.
    
        cat /etc/bind/db.domain.com
        
        ;
        ; BIND reverse data file for local loopback interface
        ;
        $ORIGIN domain.com
        $TTL 86400
        @     IN     SOA    dns1.domain.com.     hostmaster.domain.com. (
                            2001062501 ; serial
                            21600      ; refresh after 6 hours
                            3600       ; retry after 1 hour
                            604800     ; expire after 1 week
                            86400 )    ; minimum TTL of 1 day
        
              IN     NS     ns1.domain.com.
              IN     NS     ns2.domain.com.
        
              IN     MX     10     mx.domain.com.
              IN     MX     20     mx2.domain.com.
        
                     IN     A       10.129.14.5
        
        server1      IN     A       10.129.14.5
        server2      IN     A       10.129.14.7
        ns1          IN     A       10.129.14.2
        ns2          IN     A       10.129.14.3
        
        ftp          IN     CNAME   server1
        mx           IN     CNAME   server1
        mx2          IN     CNAME   server2
        www          IN     CNAME   server2

3.  Reverse Name Resolution Zone Files

    Indeed, for a `Fully Qualified Domain Name` (`FQDN`) to resolve to an IP address, the DNS server requires a reverse lookup file. This file utilizes `PTR` (Pointer) records to map the computer name (FQDN) to the last octet of an IP address, correlating it with the respective host. PTR records play a crucial role in the reverse translation of IP addresses into corresponding names, as highlighted in the table previously mentioned.
    
        cat /etc/bind/db.10.129.14
        
        ;
        ; BIND reverse data file for local loopback interface
        ;
        $ORIGIN 14.129.10.in-addr.arpa
        $TTL 86400
        @     IN     SOA    dns1.domain.com.     hostmaster.domain.com. (
                            2001062501 ; serial
                            21600      ; refresh after 6 hours
                            3600       ; retry after 1 hour
                            604800     ; expire after 1 week
                            86400 )    ; minimum TTL of 1 day
        
              IN     NS     ns1.domain.com.
              IN     NS     ns2.domain.com.
        
        5    IN     PTR    server1.domain.com.
        7    IN     MX     mx.domain.com.
        ...SNIP...

### Dangerous Settings

DNS servers face various `vulnerabilities` that attackers exploit. Vulnerabilities targeting BIND9, for instance, are documented on `CVEdetails`. SecurityTrails also outlines popular attacks on DNS servers.

`Certain configurations` contribute to these vulnerabilities. DNS, being complex, is prone to errors, compelling administrators to implement temporary workarounds until an exact solution is found. Often, functionality takes precedence over security, prompting the release of elements to ensure parts of the infrastructure function as intended. This prioritization sometimes leads to misconfigurations and vulnerabilities within the system.

### Footprinting the Service

Footprinting DNS servers involves querying them to gather information about other name servers known to them. This is typically done using the `NS` (Name Server) record and specifying the DNS server to be queried using the "`@`" character. By doing so, one can identify additional DNS servers and query their records. However, these other servers might have distinct configurations and can be permanent for different zones.

1.  Querying Name Servers (NS Records)

    Retrieves the `NS` records for the domain "example.com", showcasing the authoritative name servers responsible for the domain.
    
        nslookup -type=NS example.com
    
        dig ns example.com @10.129.14.128

2.  DIG - Version Query

        dig CH TXT version.bind 10.129.120.85

3.  Querying ANY

    We can use the option `ANY` to view all available records. 
    
        dig any example.com @10.129.14.128

4.  Querying A Records

    Fetches the IPv4 address (`A record`) associated with the domain "example.com".
    
        nslookup example.com

5.  Querying MX Records

    Retrieves the Mail Exchange (`MX`) records for the domain "example.com", specifying mail servers responsible for email delivery.
    
        nslookup -type=MX example.com

6.  Querying TXT Records

    Fetches the text records associated with the domain "example.com", commonly used for various purposes like `SPF`, `DMARC`, and `verification purposes`
    
        nslookup -type=TXT example.com

7.  Reverse DNS Lookup (PTR Records)

    Performs a reverse `DNS lookup` to find the domain associated with the given IP address.
    
        nslookup <IP address>

8.  Querying AXFR Zone Transfer

    `Zone transfer` in DNS involves transferring zones from one server to another, commonly occurring over `TCP` port `53` through `Asynchronous Full Transfer Zone` (`AXFR`). Given the criticality of DNS for businesses, maintaining identical zone files across multiple name servers is crucial. Changes made in one server's zone must be synchronized across all servers to ensure data consistency, achieved through zone transfer.
    
    The primary name server holds the `original zone data`, while secondary servers are installed for `increased reliability`, `load distribution`, or `primary server protection`. Top-Level Domains (TLDs) often mandate multiple servers for Second Level Domains' zone files.
    
    Entries in DNS are typically managed on the primary server, either through manual edits or automated dynamic updates from a database. Servers directly providing zone file synchronization are termed masters, while those obtaining data from masters are termed slaves. A primary server functions solely as a master, while a secondary server can serve as both a slave and a master.
    
    Slaves periodically fetch the `SOA` (`Start of Authority`) record from the master, comparing serial numbers at refresh intervals (**typically one hour**). A higher serial number on the master's SOA indicates mismatched data sets between servers.
    
        dig axfr example.com @10.129.14.128
    
    1.  AXFR Zone Transfer - Internal
    
        If the administrator used a subnet for the `allow-transfer` option for testing purposes or as a workaround solution or set it to any, everyone would query the entire zone file at the DNS server. In addition, other zones can be queried, which may even show internal IP addresses and hostnames.
        
            dig axfr internal.example.com @10.129.14.128

9.  Subdomain Brute Forcing

    The individual A records with the hostnames can also be found out with the help of a brute-force attack.
    
        for sub in $(cat /opt/useful/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt);do dig $sub.example.com @10.129.14.128 | grep -v ';\|SOA' | sed -r '/^\s*$/d' | grep $sub | tee -a subdomains.txt;done
    
    Many different tools can be used for this, and most of them work in the same way. One of these tools is, for example [DNSenum](https://github.com/fwaeytens/dnsenum).
    
        dnsenum --dnsserver 10.129.14.128 --enum -p 0 -s 0 -o subdomains.txt -f /opt/useful/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt example.com

## SMTP\\25,587

`SMTP`, the `Simple Mail Transfer Protocol`, is pivotal for email transmission in IP networks. It operates between email clients and outgoing mail servers or between SMTP servers themselves. Often used alongside `IMAP` or `POP3` for managing emails, SMTP follows a client-server structure, allowing server-to-server communication where servers act as clients.

Typically, SMTP servers accept connections on `port 25`, but newer iterations also utilize TCP `port 587` for secure mail receipt. Port 587 ensures **secure communication by encrypting connections** with the `STARTTLS` command, safeguarding authentication data from being transmitted in plaintext. Authentication happens during connection initiation when clients confirm identity via a `username` and `password`, enabling email transmission by sharing sender and recipient addresses, content, and parameters. Following transmission, the server forwards the email to another SMTP server.

While SMTP primarily operates unencrypted, SSL/TLS encryption secures data from unauthorized access. Some servers opt for alternative ports like TCP 465 for encrypted SMTP connections.

An integral function of SMTP servers is `spam prevention`, often achieved through authentication mechanisms like ESMTP with SMTP-Auth, allowing only authorized users to send emails. The SMTP client (`Mail User Agent` - `MUA`) submits emails to the SMTP server (`Mail Transfer Agent` - `MTA`), scrutinized for size and spam before storage. Occasionally, a Mail Submission Agent (`MSA`) or Relay server precedes the `MTA`, checking email validity.

Upon reaching the destination SMTP server, data packets assemble into complete emails, forwarded to the Mail Delivery Agent (MDA), and delivered to the recipient's mailbox, accessed through POP3 or IMAP protocols. The journey typically involves.
Client (`MUA`) ➞ Submission Agent (`MSA`) ➞ Open Relay (`MTA`) ➞ Mail Delivery Agent (`MDA`) ➞ Mailbox (`POP3/IMAP`).

SMTP, while vital for email transmission, presents inherent drawbacks in its network protocol.

-   One primary limitation is the absence of a reliable delivery confirmation when sending emails through SMTP. Though the protocol allows for such notifications, it lacks standardized formatting. Typically, only an English-language error message, accompanied by the undelivered message's header, is returned, making confirmation unusable.
-   Moreover, SMTP `doesn't authenticate` users during connection establishment, leading to sender unreliability. This loophole is exploited through open `SMTP relays`, commonly abused for mass spam distribution. Perpetrators utilize arbitrary fake sender addresses to avoid tracing (`mail spoofing`). To counter such misuse, various security techniques have been adopted. Suspicious emails are either rejected or directed to quarantine (`spam folder`). Security protocols like `DomainKeys` (`DKIM`) and `Sender Policy Framework` (`SPF`) play key roles in addressing these issues. `DKIM` verifies email authenticity **by adding digital signatures**, while `SPF` defines email sender legitimacy **by validating sender IP addresses** against domain records.

These security measures aim to mitigate email abuse and improve SMTP's reliability and authenticity, enhancing the overall integrity and trustworthiness of email communication.

### Default Configuration

Each SMTP server can be configured in many ways, as can all other services. However, there are differences because the SMTP server is only responsible for sending and forwarding emails.

### Telnet - HELO/EHLO

To interact with the SMTP server, we can use the `telnet` tool to initialize a TCP connection with the SMTP server. The actual initialization of the session is done with the command mentioned above, `HELO` or `EHLO`.

    telnet 10.129.14.128 25
    
    Trying 10.129.14.128...

### Telnet - VRFY

The command `VRFY` can be used to enumerate existing users on the system. However, this does not always work. Depending on how the SMTP server is configured, the SMTP server may issue `code 252` and confirm the existence of a user that does not exist on the system. A list of all SMTP response codes can be found here.

    telnet 10.129.14.128 25

## IMAP / POP3\\110,143,993,995

`Internet Message Access Protocol` (`MAP`) enables remote email management with folder structures, unlike `Post Office Protocol` (`POP3`), facilitating online access to emails directly on the server. It supports synchronization across multiple clients, offering advanced functionalities like hierarchical mailboxes and access to multiple mailboxes within a session. With IMAP, emails remain on the server until deletion, ensuring a uniform database across clients. POP3, on the other hand, does not have the same functionality as IMAP, and it only provides listing, retrieving, and deleting emails as functions at the email server. 

Clients access and create local copies of email structures, ensuring consistency across several devices. IMAP operates via port 143, using text-based ASCII commands for communication, and requires user authentication upon connection establishment. `SMTP` complements `IMAP` for email transmission and offers accessibility to sent emails across multiple devices by copying them into IMAP folders.

However, IMAP typically operates unencrypted, transmitting data in plaintext. To bolster security, email servers often require `encrypted` IMAP sessions `using SSL/TLS`, enhancing email traffic security and preventing unauthorized mailbox access. This encrypted connection usually utilizes standard port 143 or an alternative like `993`, depending on the implementation.


<a id="orgb1087c6"></a>

### Default Configuration

Exploring detailed configurations of `IMAP` and `POP3` protocols is intricate due to their numerous options.

    I recommend creating a VM locally and install the two packages dovecot-imapd, and dovecot-pop3d using apt and play around with the configurations and experiment.

In the documentation of Dovecot, we can find the individual [core](https://doc.dovecot.org/settings/core/) settings and [service](https://doc.dovecot.org/configuration_manual/service_configuration/) configuration options that can be utilized for our experiments.

### Dangerous Settings

Misconfigured settings within these email servers can expose critical information. Debugging executed commands or attempting to log in `anonymously`, akin to `FTP services`, might reveal vulnerabilities. While numerous companies opt for third-party email providers like Google or Microsoft, some manage their own mail servers for privacy and control reasons. However, this self-management presents risks. Administrators' configuration errors can inadvertently grant access to all sent and received emails, potentially containing sensitive or confidential information. Some of these critical configuration options include:

## SNMP\\161(UDP)

`Simple Network Management Protocol` (`SNMP`) was created to monitor network devices.
In addition, this protocol can also be used to handle configuration tasks and change settings remotely.
In addition, configuration tasks can be handled, and settings can be made remotely using this standard.
In addition to the pure exchange of information, SNMP also transmits control commands using agents over `UDP` port `161`.
While in classical communication, it is always the client who actively requests information from the server, SNMP also enables the use of so-called `traps` over UDP port 162.
If a device is configured accordingly, an SNMP trap is sent to the client once a specific event occurs on the server-side.

1.  MIB

    The `Management Information Base` (`MIB`) is a standardized format to store device information in SNMP, ensuring interoperability across devices and systems. It's a textual file outlining all SNMP queryable objects, organized in a tree hierarchy via unique Object Identifiers (`OIDs`). These files `describe` where to find specific `information`, along with details like data types and access rights, but don't contain the actual data.

2.  OID

    `Object Identifiers` (`OIDs`) are numerical sequences representing nodes in a hierarchical structure. Each `OID` uniquely identifies a node in the tree, indicating its position and specificity. They're composed of integers concatenated with dot notation, enabling reference and lookup in the Object Identifier Registry.

3.  SNMPv1

    SNMP versions vary in their functionalities and security. `SNMPv1` is still prevalent in smaller networks, supporting information retrieval, device configuration, and event notifications. However, its lack of authentication or encryption makes it susceptible to unauthorized access and data interception.

4.  SNMPv2

    `SNMPv2`, specifically v2c, retains `SNMPv1's security issues`. While it introduces additional functionalities, it suffers from transmitting the community string in plain text, lacking inherent encryption.

5.  SNMPv3

    `SNMPv3` significantly improves security by implementing features like `username/password` authentication and data encryption using `pre-shared keys`. However, its complexity in configuration surpasses its predecessors.

6.  Community Strings

    Community strings function as passwords controlling access to requested information. Despite the advancements in SNMPv3, many organizations remain on SNMPv2 due to the complexity of transitioning. This ongoing use of SNMPv2 without encryption poses security risks, allowing interception of community strings during transmission, leading to potential unauthorized access. This scenario concerns administrators, as attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities without encryption, accessing sensitive information with intercepted community strings.


<a id="orgc076c55"></a>

### Default Configuration

The default configuration of the SNMP daemon defines the basic settings for the service, which include the IP addresses, ports, MIB, OIDs, authentication, and community strings.

1.  SNMP Daemon Config

        cat /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf | grep -v "#" | sed -r '/^\s*$/d'

### Footprinting the Service

For footprinting SNMP, we can use tools like `snmpwalk`, `onesixtyone`, and `braa`.


<a id="orge9ea254"></a>

### SNMPwalk

    snmpwalk -v2c -c public 10.129.14.128

    onesixtyone -c /opt/useful/SecLists/Discovery/SNMP/snmp.txt 10.129.14.128


<a id="org15eac1f"></a>

### Braa

Often, when certain community strings are bound to specific IP addresses, they are named with the hostname of the host, and sometimes even symbols are added to these names to make them more challenging to identify. 

    sudo apt install braa
    braa <community string>@<IP>:.1.3.6.*   # Syntax
    braa public@10.129.14.128:.1.3.6.*

## MySQL\\3306

MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (`RDBMS`) that allows users to manage and store data.
MySQL uses `Structured Query Language` (`SQL`) for querying, managing, and manipulating data within databases.
MySQL works according to the `client-server` principle and consists of a MySQL server and one or more MySQL clients.

The client-server architecture in MySQL (and in many other database systems) separates the responsibilities of managing the database (<sub>server</sub>\_) from interacting with it (<sub>client</sub>\_).


<a id="org045de55"></a>

### core

1.  Mysql Server

    It's the software that actually `stores` and `manages` the databases. The server is responsible for **handling** **data storage**, **retrieval**, **access control**, and various other database-related tasks. 

2.  MySQL Clients

    The client is the interface that allows users or applications to interact with the MySQL server. It could be command-line tools like the `mysql command`, graphical user interfaces (GUIs) like `phpMyAdmin`, or various programming `language libraries` (like Python's mysql-connector, PHP's mysqli, etc.).

3.  MySQL Commands

    MySQL manages data using SQL commands; errors from SQL injections can expose unintended interactions. It manipulates data in tables, alters structures, and manages users.
    
    `MariaDB`, a MySQL derivative, emerged after the main developer left MySQL AB post-Oracle acquisition, continuing open-source database development.


<a id="org826edbf"></a>

### Default Configuration

It is so large that entire professions, such as `database administrator` (`DBA`), deal with almost nothing but databases.

    sudo apt install mysql-server -y
    cat /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf | grep -v "#" | sed -r '/^\s*$/d'
    
    [client]
    port		= 3306
    socket		= /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock

## MSSQL\\1433

"`MSSQL`," it refers to Microsoft SQL Server, a relational database management system developed by Microsoft. Like MySQL, it's used to store and retrieve data as requested by other software applications. However, MSSQL is a proprietary system, unlike MySQL, which is open-source.

Microsoft SQL Server is known for its robustness, scalability, and integration with other Microsoft products. It supports various editions catering to different needs, ranging from small applications to large enterprise-level solutions. It utilizes `Transact-SQL` (T-SQL), a <span class="underline">variant of SQL</span>, for querying and managing data.


<a id="org9e1d742"></a>

### Core

1.  MSSQL Clients

    [SQL Server Management Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver15) (`SSMS`) comes as a feature that can be installed with the MSSQL install package or can be downloaded & installed separately.
    Keep in mind that since SSMS is a client-side application, it can be installed and used on any system an admin or developer is planning to manage the database from.
    Many other clients can be used to access a database running on MSSQL:
    
    -   [mssql-cli](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/tools/mssql-cli?view=sql-server-ver15)
    -   [SQL Server PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/powershell/sql-server-powershell?view=sql-server-ver15)
    -   [HeidiSQL](https://www.heidisql.com/)
    -   [SQLPro](https://www.macsqlclient.com/)
    -   [Impacket's mssqlclient.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/mssqlclient.py)

<a id="orga8d0aef"></a>

### Default Configuration

When an admin initially installs and configures MSSQL to be network accessible, the SQL service will likely run as `NT SERVICE\MSSQLSERVER`.
Authentication being set to `Windows Authentication~` means that the underlying Windows OS will process the login request and use either the local SAM database or the domain controller (hosting Active Directory) before allowing connectivity to the database management system.


<a id="org971648e"></a>

### Dangerous Settings

In an IT administrator's shoes during an engagement, it's crucial to consider potential `misconfigurations` that might compromise systems. The IT landscape is fast-paced, often juggling multiple projects, leading to the potential for errors—where even a small misconfiguration can jeopardize a critical server or service.

This risk extends to MSSQL configurations, where admins might inadvertently set up:

-   `Unencrypted MSSQL Client Connections`: Failure to use encryption between clients and the MSSQL server, exposing data during transmission.
-   `Self-Signed Certificates for Encryption`: Reliance on self-signed certificates, vulnerable to spoofing, despite using encryption, risking compromised security.
-   `Usage of Named Pipes`: Vulnerability arising from the use of named pipes, potentially open to exploitation.
-   `Weak or Default 'sa' Credentials`: Overlooking the disabling of default 'sa' (`system administrator`) credentials, leaving a significant security loophole if left unchanged or set with weak passwords.

## Oracle TNS\\1521

The `Oracle Transparent Network Substrate` (`TNS`) server is a communication protocol that facilitates communication between Oracle databases and applications over networks.
TNS supports various networking protocols between Oracle databases and client applications, such as `IPX/SPX` and `TCP/IP` protocol stacks.
Over time, TNS has been updated to support newer technologies, including IPv6 and SSL/TLS encryption which makes it more suitable for the following purposes:

-   Name Resolution
-   Connection management
-   Load balancing
-   Security


<a id="orgc5c496f"></a>

### Default Configuration

The configuration files for Oracle TNS are called `tnsnames.ora` and `listener.ora` and are typically located in the `ORACLE_HOME/network/admin` directory. The plain text file contains configuration information for Oracle database instances and other network services that use the TNS protocol.

Each database or service has a unique entry in the [tnsnames.ora](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/network.112/e10835/tnsnames.htm#NETRF007) file, containing the necessary information for clients to connect to the service.
<span class="underline">Tnsnames.ora</span>

    ORCL =
      (DESCRIPTION =
        (ADDRESS_LIST =
          (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = 10.129.11.102)(PORT = 1521))
        )
        (CONNECT_DATA =
          (SERVER = DEDICATED)
          (SERVICE_NAME = orcl)
        )
      ) 

Here we can see a service called `ORCL`, which is listening on port `TCP/1521` on the IP address `10.129.11.102`. Clients should use the service name orcl when connecting to the service.

<span class="underline">Listener.ora</span>

    SID_LIST_LISTENER =
      (SID_LIST =
        (SID_DESC =
          (SID_NAME = PDB1)
          (ORACLE_HOME = C:\oracle\product\19.0.0\dbhome_1)
          (GLOBAL_DBNAME = PDB1)
          (SID_DIRECTORY_LIST =
            (SID_DIRECTORY =
              (DIRECTORY_TYPE = TNS_ADMIN)
              (DIRECTORY = C:\oracle\product\19.0.0\dbhome_1\network\admin)
            )
          )
        )
      )
    
    LISTENER =
      (DESCRIPTION_LIST =
        (DESCRIPTION =
          (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = orcl.inlanefreight.htb)(PORT = 1521))
          (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = IPC)(KEY = EXTPROC1521))
        )
      )
    
      ADR_BASE_LISTENER = C:\oracle

In short, the client-side Oracle Net Services software uses the tnsnames.ora file to resolve service names to network addresses, while the listener process uses the listener.ora file to determine the services it should listen to and the behavior of the listener.

Oracle databases can be protected by using so-called PL/SQL Exclusion List (`PlsqlExclusionList`). It is a user-created text file that needs to be placed in the `$ORACLE_HOME/sqldeveloper` directory, and it contains the names of PL/SQL packages or types that should be excluded from execution.

### Tools

Before we can enumerate the TNS listener and interact with it, we need to download a few packages and tools for our Pwnbox instance in case it does not have these already.

    #!/bin/bash
    
    sudo apt-get install libaio1 python3-dev alien python3-pip -y
    git clone https://github.com/quentinhardy/odat.git
    cd odat/
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    sudo apt install oracle-instantclient-basic oracle-instantclient-devel oracle-instantclient-sqlplus -y
    pip3 install cx_Oracle
    sudo apt-get install python3-scapy -y
    sudo pip3 install colorlog termcolor pycryptodome passlib python-libnmap
    sudo pip3 install argcomplete && sudo activate-global-python-argcomplete

1.  ODAT

        ./odat.py -h
    
    `Oracle Database Attacking Tool` (`ODAT`) is an open-source penetration testing tool written in Python and designed to enumerate and exploit vulnerabilities in Oracle databases.

2.  Nmap

        sudo nmap -p1521 -sV 10.129.204.235 --open

3.  Nmap - SID Bruteforcing

    The `SIDs` are an essential part of the connection process, as it identifies the specific instance of the database the client wants to connect to.
    If the client specifies an incorrect SID, the connection attempt will fail.
    \*There are various ways to enumerate, or better said, guess `SIDs`. Therefore we can use tools like `nmap`, `hydra`, `odat`, and others. Let us use `nmap` first.
    
        sudo nmap -p1521 -sV 10.129.204.235 --open --script oracle-sid-brute

4.  ODAT

        ./odat.py all -s 10.129.204.235

5.  SQLplus - Log In

        sqlplus scott/tiger@10.129.204.235/XE
    
    If you come across the following error sqlplus: error while loading shared libraries: libsqlplus.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory, please execute the below, taken from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27717312/sqlplus-error-while-loading-shared-libraries-libsqlplus-so-cannot-open-shared).
    
        sudo sh -c "echo /usr/lib/oracle/12.2/client64/lib > /etc/ld.so.conf.d/oracle-instantclient.conf";sudo ldconfig

6.  Oracle RDBMS - Interaction

        SQL> select table_name from all_tables;
        SQL> select * from user_role_privs;

7.  Oracle RDBMS - Database Enumeration

    Here, the user scott has no administrative privileges. However, we can try using this account to log in as the System Database Admin (sysdba), giving us higher privileges. This is possible when the user scott has the appropriate privileges typically granted by the database administrator or used by the administrator him/herself.
    
        sqlplus scott/tiger@10.129.204.235/XE as sysdba

8.  Oracle RDBMS - Extract Password Hashes

        SQL> select name, password from sys.user$;

9.  Oracle RDBMS - File Upload

## IPMI\\623

`Intelligent Platform Management Interface` (`IPMI`) is a set of standardized specifications for hardware-based host management systems used for system management and monitoring.
IPMI provides `sysadmins` with the `ability` to `manage` and `monitor` systems even if they are powered off or in an unresponsive state.
It operates using a direct network connection to the system's hardware and does not require access to the operating system via a login shell.
IPMI can also be used for:

-   Before the OS has booted to modify BIOS settings
-   When the host is fully powered down
-   Access to a host after a system failure

When not being used for these tasks, IPMI can monitor a range of different things such as system temperature, voltage, fan status, and power supplies. It can also be used for querying inventory information, reviewing hardware logs, and alerting using SNMP. The host system can be powered off, but the IPMI module requires a power source and a LAN connection to work correctly.
This addressing mechanism is an absolute prerequisite for successfully transmitting data and network monitoring using SNMP.
To function, IPMI requires the following components:

-   Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) - A micro-controller and essential component of an IPMI
-   Intelligent Chassis Management Bus (ICMB) - An interface that permits communication from one chassis to another
-   Intelligent Platform Management Bus (IPMB) - extends the BMC
-   IPMI Memory - stores things such as the system event log, repository store data, and more
-   Communications Interfaces - local system interfaces, serial and LAN interfaces, ICMB and PCI Management Bus


<a id="org11abe90"></a>

### Footprinting the Service

IPMI communicates over port `623 UDP`. Systems that use the IPMI protocol are called `Baseboard Management Controllers` (BMCs). BMCs are typically implemented as embedded ARM systems running Linux, and connected directly to the host's motherboard. BMCs are built into many motherboards but can also be added to a system as a PCI card.

### Dangerous Settings

If default credentials do not work to access a BMC, we can turn to a flaw in the RAKP protocol in IPMI 2.0. During the authentication process, the server sends a salted SHA1 or MD5 hash of the user's password to the client before authentication takes place.
And crack them with:

    hashcat -m 7300 ipmi.txt -a 3 ?1?1?1?1?1?1?1?1 -1 ?d?u

# Remote Management Protocols


<a id="org128cbe1"></a>

## Linux


<a id="orgf64c444"></a>

### SSH\\22

`Secure Shell` (`SSH`) facilitates secure, encrypted connections between computers over potentially insecure networks, typically on TCP port 22.
When managing a remote host, SSH allows interaction via command line or GUI. It enables `sending commands`, `file transfers`, and `port forwarding`, necessitating a secure SSH connection and authentication.

1.  Public Key Authentication

    1.  Server and Client Authentication
    
        Initially , the SSH server and client authenticate each other. The server sends a certificate to verify its identity, reducing the risk of third-party intervention during the initial connection.
    
    2.  Client Authentication
    
        Following server authentication, the client must prove access authorization. Typically, the server possesses an encrypted hash of the user's password. However, for enhanced security and convenience, public key and private key pairs are used instead.
        
        1.  Private Key
        
            Individual to the `user's computer` and secured with a passphrase stronger than typical passwords, the private key remains solely on the user's computer, ensuring its secrecy. 
        
        2.  Public Key on Server
        
            The server generates a cryptographic challenge based on the client's public key and sends it. The client decrypts this challenge with its private key, providing the solution to the server, thereby confirming a legitimate connection.

2.  Default Configuration

    The [sshd<sub>config</sub>](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/sshd_config) file, responsible for the OpenSSH server, has only a few of the settings configured by default.
    
        cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config  | grep -v "#" | sed -r '/^\s*$/d'

        Allowing password authentication allows us to brute-force a known username for possible passwords. Many different methods can be used to guess the passwords of users. For this purpose, specific patterns` are usually used to mutate the most commonly used passwords and, frighteningly, correct them.

4.  Footprinting the Service

    One of the tools we can use to fingerprint the SSH server is [ssh-audit](https://github.com/jtesta/ssh-audit).
    
        git clone https://github.com/jtesta/ssh-audit.git && cd ssh-audit
        ./ssh-audit.py 10.129.14.132
    
    1.  Change Authentication Method
    
            ssh -v cry0l1t3@10.129.14.132
        
        For potential brute-force attacks, we can specify the authentication method with the SSH client option `PreferredAuthentications`.
        
            ssh -v cry0l1t3@10.129.14.132 -o PreferredAuthentications=password


<a id="orgd493702"></a>

### Rsync\\873

[Rsync](https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync) is a fast and efficient tool for locally and remotely copying files. It can be used to copy files locally on a given machine and to/from remote hosts.
By default, it uses port `873` and can be configured to use ssh.

1.  Scann

        sudo nmap -sV -p 873 127.0.0.1

2.  Probing for Accessible Shares

        nc -nv 127.0.0.1 873

3.  Enumerating an Open Share

        rsync -av --list-only rsync://127.0.0.1/<share>
    
    If Rsync is configured to use SSH to transfer files, we could modify our commands to include the `-e ssh` flag, or -e "`ssh -p2222`" if a non-standard port is in use for SSH.


<a id="org1bfdb7e"></a>

### R-Services\\512,513,514

R-Services are a suite of services hosted to enable remote access or issue commands between Unix hosts over TCP/IP.
No longer used in favor of ssh, much like `telnet`, r-services transmit information from client to server(and vice versa.) over the network in an unencrypted format, making it possible for attackers to intercept network traffic (passwords, login information, etc.) by performing man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
The [R-commands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_r-commands) suite consists of the following programs:

-   rcp (`remote copy`)
-   rexec (`remote execution`)
-   rlogin (`remote login`)
-   rsh (`remote shell`)

## Windows

The main components used for remote management of Windows and Windows servers are the following:

-   Remote Desktop Protocol (`RDP`)
-   Windows Remote Management (`WinRM`)
-   Windows Management Instrumentation (`WMI`)

### RDP\\3389

RDP works at the application layer in the TCP/IP reference model, typically utilizing TCP port `3389` as the `transport protocol`.
For an RDP session to be established, both the network firewall and the firewall on the server must allow connections from the outside.
In addition, port forwarding must be set up on the NAT router in the direction of the server.
RDP has handled [Transport Layer Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) (`TLS/SSL`) since Windows Vista, which means that all data, and especially the login process, is protected in the network by its good encryption.
The `Remote Desktop` service is installed by default on Windows servers and does not require additional external applications.
This service can be activated using the `Server Manager` and comes with the default setting to allow connections to the service only to hosts with [Network level authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Level_Authentication) (`NLA`).

1.  Footprinting the Service

    Scanning the RDP service can quickly give us a lot of information about the host. For example, we can determine if `NLA` is enabled on the server or not, the product version, and the hostname.
    
    1.  Nmap
    
            nmap -sV -sC 10.129.201.248 -p3389 --script rdp*
        
        In addition, we can use `--packet-trace` to track the individual packages and inspect their contents manually. We can see that the `RDP cookies` (`mstshash=nmap`) used by Nmap to interact with the RDP server can be identified by threat hunters and various security services such as Endpoint Detection and Response (`EDR`), and can lock us out as penetration testers on hardened networks.
        
            nmap -sV -sC 10.129.201.248 -p3389 --packet-trace --disable-arp-ping -n

2.  RDP Security Check - Install

    A Perl script named [rdp-sec-check.pl](https://github.com/CiscoCXSecurity/rdp-sec-check) has also been developed by [Cisco CX Security Labs](https://github.com/CiscoCXSecurity) that can unauthentically identify the security settings of RDP servers based on the handshakes.
    
        sudo cpan

3.  RDP Security Check

        git clone https://github.com/CiscoCXSecurity/rdp-sec-check.git && cd rdp-sec-check
        ./rdp-sec-check.pl 10.129.201.248

4.  Initiate an RDP Session

    Authentication and connection to such RDP servers can be made in several ways. For example, we can connect to RDP servers on Linux using `xfreerdp`, `rdesktop`, or `Remmina` and interact with the GUI of the server accordingly.
    
        xfreerdp /u:cry0l1t3 /p:"P455w0rd!" /v:10.129.201.248

### WinRM\\5985,5986

The `Windows Remote Management` (`WinRM`) is a simple Windows integrated remote management protocol based on the command line. WinRM uses the `Simple Object Access Protocol` (`SOAP`) to establish connections to remote hosts and their applications.
Another component that fits WinRM for administration is Windows Remote Shell (`WinRS`), which lets us execute arbitrary commands on the remote system.

1.  Footprinting the Service

    As we already know, WinRM uses TCP ports 5985 (`HTTP`) and 5986 (`HTTPS`) by default, which we can scan using Nmap.
    
    1.  Nmap WinRM
    
            nmap -sV -sC 10.129.201.248 -p5985,5986 --disable-arp-ping -n
        
        If we want to find out whether one or more remote servers can be reached via WinRM, we can easily do this with the help of PowerShell. The [West-WsMan](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.wsman.management/test-wsman?view=powershell-7.2) `cmdlet` is responsible for this, and the host's name in question is passed to it.
    
    2.  Initiate an RDB in UNIX
    
        In Linux-based environments, we can use the tool called [evil-winrm](https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm), another penetration testing tool designed to interact with WinRM.
        
            evil-winrm -i 10.129.201.248 -u Cry0l1t3 -p P455w0rD!

### WMI\\135

Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) is Microsoft's implementation and also an extension of the Common Information Model (CIM), core functionality of the standardized Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM) for the Windows platform.
WMI is typically accessed via PowerShell, VBScript, or the Windows Management Instrumentation Console (WMIC).

1.  Footprinting the Service

    The initialization of the WMI communication always takes place on TCP port 135, and after the successful establishment of the connection, the communication is moved to a random port.
    
    Program [wmiexec.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/wmiexec.py) from the Impacket toolkit can be used for this.
    
        /usr/share/doc/python3-impacket/examples/wmiexec.py Cry0l1t3:"P455w0rD!"@10.129.201.248 "hostname"
