# Object
An object can be defined as ANY resource present within an Active Directory environment such as OUs, printers, users, domain controllers, etc.

# Attributes
Every object in Active Directory has an associated set of [attributes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/attributes-all) used to define characteristics of the given object. A computer object contains attributes such as the hostname and DNS name. All attributes in AD have an associated LDAP name that can be used when performing LDAP queries, such as `displayName` for `Full Name` and `given name` for `First Name`.

# Schema
The Active Directory schema is essentially the blueprint of any enterprise environment. It defines what types of objects can exist in the AD database and their associated attributes. It lists definitions corresponding to AD objects and holds information about each object. For example, users in AD belong to the class "user," and computer objects to "computer," and so on. Each object has its own information (some required to be set and others optional) that are stored in Attributes. When an object is created from a class, this is called instantiation, and an object created from a specific class is called an instance of that class. For example, if we take the computer RDS01. This computer object is an instance of the "computer" class in Active Directory.

# Domain
A domain is a logical group of objects such as computers, users, OUs, groups, etc. We can think of each domain as a different city within a state or country. Domains can operate entirely independently of one another or be connected via trust relationships.

# Forest
A forest is a collection of Active Directory domains. It is the topmost container and contains all of the AD objects introduced below, including but not limited to domains, users, groups, computers, and Group Policy objects. A forest can contain one or multiple domains and be thought of as a state in the US or a country within the EU. Each forest operates independently but may have various trust relationships with other forests.

# Tree
A tree is a collection of Active Directory domains that begins at a single root domain. A forest is a collection of AD trees. Each domain in a tree shares a boundary with the other domains. A parent-child trust relationship is formed when a domain is added under another domain in a tree. Two trees in the same forest cannot share a name (namespace). Let's say we have two trees in an AD forest: `inlanefreight.local` and `ilfreight.local`. A child domain of the first would be `corp.inlanefreight.local` while a child domain of the second could be `corp.ilfreight.local`. All domains in a tree share a standard Global Catalog which contains all information about objects that belong to the tree.

# Container 
Container objects hold other objects and have a defined place in the directory subtree hierarchy.

# Leaf
Leaf objects do not contain other objects and are found at the end of the subtree hierarchy.

# Global Unique Identifier (GUID)
A [GUID](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/a-objectguid) is a unique 128-bit value assigned when a domain user or group is created. This GUID value is unique across the enterprise, similar to a MAC address. Every single object created by Active Directory is assigned a GUID, not only user and group objects. The GUID is stored in the `ObjectGUID` attribute. When querying for an AD object (such as a user, group, computer, domain, domain controller, etc.), we can query for its `objectGUID` value using PowerShell or search for it by specifying its distinguished name, GUID, SID, or SAM account name. GUIDs are used by AD to identify objects internally. Searching in Active Directory by GUID value is probably the most accurate and reliable way to find the exact object you are looking for, especially if the global catalog may contain similar matches for an object name. Specifying the `ObjectGUID` value when performing AD enumeration will ensure that we get the most accurate results pertaining to the object we are searching for information about. The `ObjectGUID` property `never` changes and is associated with the object for as long as that object exists in the domain.

# Security principals
[Security principals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/security-principals) are anything that the operating system can authenticate, including users, computer accounts, or even threads/processes that run in the context of a user or computer account (i.e., an application such as Tomcat running in the context of a service account within the domain). In AD, security principles are domain objects that can manage access to other resources within the domain. We can also have local user accounts and security groups used to control access to resources on only that specific computer. These are not managed by AD but rather by the [Security Accounts Manager (SAM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Account_Manager).
