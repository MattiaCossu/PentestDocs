# File System
Windows support 5 type of file system, the mains are _FAT32_ and _NTFS_.

_FAT32_ -> Grant compatibility whit some kind of device, and cross compatibility whit OS.
Use 32 BIT for contiguous blocks.
The cons are limiting, for example the max disk size supported are 4 GB.
Do not integrate security mechanism for encryption or compression the data.
For that for permit encryption we have to use third party software. 

_NTFS_ -> New Technology File System is reliable and can restore file system consistency in case of system failure.
Out of the box provides set of granular permission.
Support Large Partitions, and it has built-in journaling, which means that changes to files ( add, edit, delete ) are recorded.
We have a few cons like poor compatibility whit mobile device and old device  

##### NTFS Permission 
NTFS have granular permission like:
- _Full Control_ -> Allows reading, writing , changing, deleting of files/folder.
- _Modify_ -> Allows reading, writing, and deleting of files/folders.
- _List Folder Contents_ -> Allows for viewing and listing folders and subfolders as well as executing files. Folders only inherit this permission.
- _Read and Execute_ -> Allows for viewing and listing folders and subfolders as well as executing files. Folders only inherit this permission.
- _Write_ -> Allows for adding files to folders and subfolders and writing to a file.
- _Read_ -> Allows for viewing and listing of folders and subfolders and viewing a file's contents.
- _Traverse Folder_ -> This allows or denies the ability to move through folders to reach other files or folders.

##### Integrity Control Access Control List (icacls)
#icacls is powerful utility for view and manage NTFS permission.
```cmd
icacls                                 # in folder context
icacls c:\<PATH>                       # out of folder 
```

The resource access level is listed after each user in the output. The possible inheritance settings are:
- `(CI)`: container inherit -> only subfolders of main folder (only folder)
- `(OI)`: object inherit -> only file in a directory no subfolder (only file)
- `(IO)`: inherit only -> only in child item and not in main folder 
- `(NP)`: do not propagate inherit -> inherit by a child ones time and stop inherit
- `(I)`: permission inherited from parent container -> permission inherit by father

Basic access permissions are as follows:
- `F` : full access
- `D` :  delete access
- `N` :  no access
- `M` :  modify access
- `RX` :  read and execute access
- `R` :  read-only access
- `W` :  write-only access

# Services 
Services in windows are manged by system called `Service Control Manager` (SCM), accessible via gui by _services.msc_, MMC add on component.

Via cli we can use _sc.exe_ by PowerShell cmdlet `Get-Service`.
```powershell
Get-Service | ? {$_.Status -eq "Running"} | select -First 2 |fl
```

A service can appear:
- _Running_
- _Stopped_
- _Paused_

A service can be launch:
- Automatic at system boot
- Manually
- Automatic at boot but with delay

We have three type of service:
- `Local Service`
- `Network Service`
- `System Service`

#### Debug a process
[Process Explorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer) is a part of the Sysinternals tool suite. This tool can show which handles and DLL processes are loaded when a program runs.

#### Interact with a services
We can use `sc` for interactr w
