# File System
Windows support 5 type of file system, the mains are _FAT32_ and _NTFS_.

_FAT32_ -> Grant compatibility whit some kind of device, and cross compatibility whit OS.
Use 32 BIT for contiguous blocks.
The cons are limiting, for example the max disk size supported are 4 GB.
Do not integrate security mechanism for encryption or compression the data.
For that for permit encryption we have to use third party software. 

_NTFS_ -> New Technology File System is reliable and can restore file system consistency in case of system failure.
Out of the box provides set of granular permission.
Support Large Partitions, and it has built-in journaling, which means that changes to files ( add, edit, delete ) are recorded.
We have a few cons like poor compatibility whit mobile device and old device  

##### NTFS Permission 
NTFS have granular permission like:
- _Full Control_ -> Allows reading, writing , changing, deleting of files/folder.
- _Modify_ -> Allows reading, writing, and deleting of files/folders.
- _List Folder Contents_ -> Allows for viewing and listing folders and subfolders as well as executing files. Folders only inherit this permission.
- _Read and Execute_ -> Allows for viewing and listing folders and subfolders as well as executing files. Folders only inherit this permission.
- _Write_ -> Allows for adding files to folders and subfolders and writing to a file.
- _Read_ -> Allows for viewing and listing of folders and subfolders and viewing a file's contents.
- _Traverse Folder_ -> This allows or denies the ability to move through folders to reach other files or folders.

##### Integrity Control Access Control List (icacls)
#icacls is powerful utility for view and manage NTFS permission.
```cmd
icacls                                 # in folder context
icacls c:\<PATH>                       # out of folder 
```

The resource access level is listed after each user in the output. The possible inheritance settings are:
- `(CI)`: container inherit -> only subfolders of main folder (only folder)
- `(OI)`: object inherit -> only file in a directory no subfolder (only file)
- `(IO)`: inherit only -> only in child item and not in main folder 
- `(NP)`: do not propagate inherit -> inherit by a child ones time and stop inherit
- `(I)`: permission inherited from parent container -> permission inherit by father

Basic access permissions are as follows:
- `F` : full access
- `D` :  delete access
- `N` :  no access
- `M` :  modify access
- `RX` :  read and execute access
- `R` :  read-only access
- `W` :  write-only access

# Services 
Services in windows are manged by system called `Service Control Manager` (SCM), accessible via gui by _services.msc_, MMC add on component.

Via cli we can use _sc.exe_ by PowerShell cmdlet `Get-Service`.
```powershell
Get-Service | ? {$_.Status -eq "Running"} | select -First 2 |fl
```

A service can appear:
- _Running_
- _Stopped_
- _Paused_

A service can be launch:
- Automatic at system boot
- Manually
- Automatic at boot but with delay

We have three type of service:
- `Local Service`
- `Network Service`
- `System Service`

#### Debug a process
[Process Explorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer) is a part of the Sysinternals tool suite. This tool can show which handles and DLL processes are loaded when a program runs.

#### Interact with a services
We can use `sc` for interact with local and network services.

_Gain Information_
```cmd
sc qc <SERVICE NAME>                                    # local
sc //hostname or ip of box query ServiceName            # network
```

_Stop and Start_
```cmd
sc stop <SERVICE NAME>
sc start <SERVICE NAME>
```

_Configure Services_
In this example we modify the bin path for wuaserv services.
```cmd
sc config wuauserv binPath=C:\Winbows\Perfectlylegitprogram.exe
```

_View Services Permission_
```cmd
sc sdshow <SERVICE NAME>   
```

This command display a _SDDL_ (`Security Descriptor Definition Language`).
It's a [security descriptor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/security-descriptors) for any [securable object](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/securable-objects) in Windows Context.

````
D:(A;;CCLCSWRPLORC;;;AU)(A;;CCDCLCSWRPWPDTLOCRSDRCWDWO;;;BA)(A;;CCDCLCSWRPWPDTLOCRSDRCWDWO;;;SY)
````

The Security Descriptor contain the object's owner and primary group containing a: 
- `Discretionary Access Control List` (`DACL`) -> controlling access to an object.
- `System Access Control List` (`SACL`). -> used to account for and log access attempts

_Table of Content_
`D: (A;;CCLCSWRPLORC;;;AU)`

1. D: - the proceeding characters are DACL permissions
2. AU: - defines the security principal Authenticated Users
3. A;; - access is allowed
4. CC - SERVICE_QUERY_CONFIG is the full name, and it is a query to the service control manager (SCM) for the service configuration
5. LC - SERVICE_QUERY_STATUS is the full name, and it is a query to the service control manager (SCM) for the current status of the service
6. SW - SERVICE_ENUMERATE_DEPENDENTS is the full name, and it will enumerate a list of dependent services
7. RP - SERVICE_START is the full name, and it will start the service
8. LO - SERVICE_INTERROGATE is the full name, and it will query the service for its current status
9. RC - READ_CONTROL is the full name, and it will query the security descriptor of the service

We can use `Get-ACL` in powershell for view some human readable information.
We have to specify a path for a service in registry.
```powershell
Get-ACL -Path HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\wuauserv | Format-List
```

# Sessions 
We have two type of session in Windows:
- _Interactive_ -> Interactive or local logon sessions, are create simple when a user log in a system with your credentials. we can require by runas a secondary logon sessions.
- _Non-Interactive_ -> Is represent by special windows account as they do not require login credential. There are 3 types of non-interactive accounts: the Local System Account, Local Service Account, and the Network Service Account. Non-interactive accounts are generally used by the Windows operating system to automatically start services and applications without requiring user interaction.

|Account|Description|
|---|---|
|Local System Account|Also known as the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account, this is the most powerful account in Windows systems. It is used for a variety of OS-related tasks, such as starting Windows services. This account is more powerful than accounts in the local administrators group.|
|Local Service Account|Known as the `NT AUTHORITY\LocalService` account, this is a less privileged version of the SYSTEM account and has similar privileges to a local user account. It is granted limited functionality and can start some services.|
|Network Service Account|This is known as the `NT AUTHORITY\NetworkService` account and is similar to a standard domain user account. It has similar privileges to the Local Service Account on the local machine. It can establish authenticated sessions for certain network services.|
# Powershell
Build on top of the `.NET`, which is used for building and running applications on Windows.
PowerShell utilizes [cmdlets](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/cmdlet-overview?view=powershell-7), which are small single-function tools built into the shell.
Cmdlet are in the form of Verb-Noun. for example `Get-ChildItem`.

##### Aliases
Many cmdlet also have a aliases.
`Set-Location` -> Aliases -> _cd_ or _sl_
`Get-ChildItem` -> Aliases -> _ls_ or _cgi_

_Get all system Aliases_
```powershell
get-alias
```

_Create New Alias_
```powershell
New-Alias -Name "Show-Files" Get-ChildItem
```
##### Get Help
_Display simple help_
```powershell
help
Get-Help Get-AppPackage
Get-AppPackage /?
```
##### Run Scripts
```powershell
.\PowerView.ps1;Get-LocalGroup | fl
```

We can import a script such as a module whit:
```powershell
Import-Module .\PowerView.ps1
```

We can then either start a command and cycle through the options or type `Get-Module` to list all loaded modules and their associated commands.
```powershell
Get-Module | select Name,ExportedCommands | fl
```

##### Execution Policy
Sometimes we will find that we are unable to run scripts on a system. This is due to a security feature called the `execution policy`, which attempts to prevent the execution of malicious scripts. The possible policies are:

|**Policy**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`AllSigned`|All scripts can run, but a trusted publisher must sign scripts and configuration files. This includes both remote and local scripts. We receive a prompt before running scripts signed by publishers that we have not yet listed as either trusted or untrusted.|
|`Bypass`|No scripts or configuration files are blocked, and the user receives no warnings or prompts.|
|`Default`|This sets the default execution policy, `Restricted` for Windows desktop machines and `RemoteSigned` for Windows servers.|
|`RemoteSigned`|Scripts can run but requires a digital signature on scripts that are downloaded from the internet. Digital signatures are not required for scripts that are written locally.|
|`Restricted`|This allows individual commands but does not allow scripts to be run. All script file types, including configuration files (`.ps1xml`), module script files (`.psm1`), and PowerShell profiles (`.ps1`) are blocked.|
|`Undefined`|No execution policy is set for the current scope. If the execution policy for ALL scopes is set to undefined, then the default execution policy of `Restricted` will be used.|
|`Unrestricted`|This is the default execution policy for non-Windows computers, and it cannot be changed. This policy allows for unsigned scripts to be run but warns the user before running scripts that are not from the local intranet zone.|

Below is an example of the current execution policy for all scopes.
```powershell
Get-ExecutionPolicy -List

        Scope ExecutionPolicy
        ----- ---------------
MachinePolicy       Undefined
   UserPolicy       Undefined
      Process       Undefined
  CurrentUser       Undefined
 LocalMachine    RemoteSigned
```

If we have a permission for modify the current policy sessions we can perform:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process
```

_Results_
```powershell
Get-ExecutionPolicy -List

        Scope ExecutionPolicy
        ----- ---------------
MachinePolicy       Undefined
   UserPolicy       Undefined
      Process          Bypass
  CurrentUser       Undefined
 LocalMachine    RemoteSigned
```
