_Copying SAM Registry Hives_
There are three registry hives that we can copy if we have local admin access on the target; each will have a specific purpose when we get to dumping and cracking the hashes. Here is a brief description of each in the table below:

| Registry Hive   | Description                                                                                                                                                |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _hklm\sam_      | Contains the hashes associated with local account passwords. We will need the hashes so we can crack them and get the user account passwords in cleartext. |
| _hklm\system_   | Contains the system bootkey, which is used to encrypt the SAM database. We will need the bootkey to decrypt the SAM database.                              |
| _hklm\security_ | Contains cached credentials for domain accounts. We may benefit from having this on a domain-joined Windows target.                                        |
We can create backups of these hives using the _reg.exe_ utility.

We can copy this registry in a file like this:
```cmd
reg.exe save hklm\sam C:\sam.save
reg.exe save hklm\system C:\system.save
reg.exe save hklm\security C:\security.save
```
